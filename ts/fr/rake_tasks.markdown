Rake Tasks
----------

### Indexing

To index your data, you can run the following rake task:

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:index  
{% endhighlight %}

There is also abbreviated versions, to save your fingers the few extra
keystrokes:

{% highlight sh %}  
rake ts:index  
rake ts:in  
{% endhighlight %}

This task, run normally, will also generate the configuration file for
Sphinx. If you decide to make custom changes, then you can disable this
generation by setting the environment variable **INDEX\_ONLY** to true.

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:index INDEX\_ONLY=true  
{% endhighlight %}

### Generating the Configuration File

If you need to just generate the configuration file, without indexing
(something that can be useful when deploying), here’s the task (and
shortcuts) to do it:

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:configure  
rake ts:conf  
rake ts:config  
{% endhighlight %}

### Starting and Stopping Sphinx

If you actually want to search against the indexed data, then you’ll
need Sphinx’s searchd daemon to be running. This can be controlled using
the following tasks:

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:start  
rake ts:start  
rake thinking\_sphinx:stop  
rake ts:stop  
{% endhighlight %}

### Handling Delta Indexes

If you’re using either the Delayed Job or Datetime/Timestamp delta
approaches, you’ll need to run a task to manage the indexing. For the
Delayed Job setup, the rake task runs constantly, processing any delta
jobs (as well as any other normal jobs if you’re using the delayed\_job
plugin elsewhere in your application).

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:delayed\_delta  
rake ts:dd  
{% endhighlight %}

For those using Datetime Deltas, you’ll need to run the following task
at a regular interval - whatever your threshold is set to.

{% highlight sh %}  
rake thinking\_sphinx:index:delta  
rake ts:in:delta  
{% endhighlight %}
