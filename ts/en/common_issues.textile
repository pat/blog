<h3 id="editconf">Editing the generated Sphinx configuration file</h3>

In most situations, you won't need to edit this file yourself, and can rely on Thinking Sphinx to generate it reliably.

If you do want to customise the settings, you'll find most options are available to set via @config/sphinx.yml@ - many are mentioned on the "Advanced Sphinx Configuration page":advanced_config.html. For those that aren't mentioned on that page, you could still try setting it, and there's a fair chance it will work.

On the off chance that you actually do need to edit the file, make sure you're running the @thinking_sphinx:reindex@ task instead of the normal @thinking_sphinx:index@ task - as the latter will always regenerate the configuration file, overwriting your customisations.

<h3 id="multiple">Running multiple instances of Sphinx on one machine</h3>

You can run as many Sphinx instances as you wish on one machine - but each must be bound to a different port. You can do this via the @config/sphinx.yml@ file - just add a setting for the port for the specific environment:

{% highlight yaml %}
staging:
  port: 9313
{% endhighlight %}

Other options are documented on the "Advanced Sphinx Configuration page":advanced_config.html.

<h3 id="weights">Viewing Result Weights</h3>

To retrieve the weights/rankings of each search result, you can enumerate through your matches using @each_with_weighting@:

{% highlight ruby %}
results.each_with_weighting do |result, weight|
  # ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

However, there is currently no clean way to get the weight of a specific result without looping though the dataset.

<h3 id="wildcards">Wildcard Searching</h3>

Sphinx can support wildcard searching (for example: Austr&lowast;), but it is turned off by default. To enable it, you need to add two settings to your config/sphinx.yml file:

{% highlight yaml %}
development:
  enable_star: 1
  min_infix_len: 1
test:
  enable_star: 1
  min_infix_len: 1
production:
  enable_star: 1
  min_infix_len: 1
{% endhighlight %}

You can set the min_infix_len value to something higher if you don't need single characters with a wildcard being matched. This may be a worthwhile fine-tuning, because the smaller the infixes are, the larger your index files become.

Don't forget to rebuild your Sphinx indexes after making this change.

{% highlight sh %}
rake thinking_sphinx:rebuild
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="slow_indexing">Slow Indexing</h3>

If Sphinx is taking a while to process all your records, there are a few common reasons for this happening. Firstly, make sure you have database indexes on any foreign key columns and any columns you filter or sort by.

Secondly - are you using fixtures? Rails' fixtures have randomly generated IDs, which are usually extremely large integers, and Sphinx isn't set up to process disparate IDs efficiently by default. To get around this, you'll need to set *sql_range_step* in your config/sphinx.yml file for the appropriate environments:

{% highlight yaml %}
development:
  sql_range_step: 10000000
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="mysql_large_fields">MySQL and Large Fields</h3>

If you've got a field that is built off multiple values in one column - ie: through a has_many association - then you may hit MySQL's default limit for string concatenation: 1024 characters. You can increase the "group_concat_max_len":http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_group_concat_max_len value by adding the following to your define_index block:

{% highlight rb %}
define_index do
  # ...
  
  set_property :group_concat_max_len => 8192
end
{% endhighlight %}

If these fields get particularly large though, then there's another setting you may need to set in your MySQL configuration: "max_allowed_packet":http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/server-system-variables.html#sysvar_max_allowed_packet, which has a default of sixteen megabytes. You can't set this option via Thinking Sphinx though (it's a rare edge case).

<h3 id="postgresql">PostgreSQL with Manual Fields and Attributes</h3>

If you're using fields or attributes defined by strings (raw SQL), then the columns used in them aren't automatically included in the GROUP BY clause of the generated SQL statement. To make sure the query is valid, you will need to explicitly add these columns to the GROUP BY clause.

A common example is if you're converting latitude and longitude columns from degrees to radians via SQL.

{% highlight ruby %}
define_index do
  # ...
  
  has "RADIANS(latitude)",  :as => :latitude,  :type => :float
  has "RADIANS(longitude)", :as => :longitude, :type => :float
  
  group_by "latitude", "longitude"
end
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="deltas">Delta Indexing Not Working</h3>

p. Often people find delta indexing isn't working on their production server. Sometimes, this is because Sphinx is running as one user on the system, and the Rails/Merb application is being served as a different user. Check your production.log and Apache/Nginx error log file for mentions of permissions issues to confirm this.

Indexing for deltas is invoked by the web user, and so needs to have access to the index files. The simplest way to ensure this is run all Thinking Sphinx rake tasks by that web user.

If you're still having issues, and you're using Passenger, read the next hint.

<h3 id="passenger">Running Delta Indexing with Passenger</h3>

p. If you're using Phusion Passenger on your production server, with delta indexing on some models, a common issue people find is that their delta indexes don't get processed.

If it's not a permissions issue (see the previous hint), another common cause is because Passenger has it's own PATH set up, and can't execute the Sphinx binaries (indexer and searchd) implicitly.

The way around this is to find out where your binaries are on the server:

{% highlight sh %}
which searchd
{% endhighlight %}

And then set the bin_path option in your config/sphinx.yml file for the production environment:

{% highlight yaml %}
production:
  bin_path: '/usr/local/bin'
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="thousand_limit">Can only access the first thousand search results</h3>

p. This is actually how Sphinx is supposed to behave. Have a read of the "Large Result Sets section of the Advanced Configuration page":advanced_config.html#large-result-sets to see why, and how to work around it if you really need to.

<h3 id="vendored">Vendored Delayed Job, AfterCommit and Riddle</h3>

p. If you've still got Delayed Job vendored as part of Thinking Sphinx and would rather use a more up-to-date version of the former, recent releases of Thinking Sphinx do not have it included any longer.

As for AfterCommit and Riddle, while they are still included for plugin installs, they're no longer in the Thinking Sphinx gem (since 1.3.3). Instead, they are considered dependencies, and will be installed as separate gems.

<h3 id="string_filters">Filtering on String Attributes</h3>

p. While you can have string columns as attributes in Sphinx, they aren't stored as strings. Instead, Sphinx figures out the alphabetical order, and gives each string an integer value to make them useful for sorting. However, this means it's close to impossible to _filter_ on these attributes.

So, to get around this, there's two options: firstly, use integer attributes instead, if you possibly can. This works for small result sets (for example: gender). Otherwise, you might want to consider manually converting the string to a CRC integer value:

{% highlight ruby %}
has "CRC32(category)", :as => :category, :type => :integer
{% endhighlight %}

This way, you can filter on it like so:

{% highlight ruby %}
Article.search 'pancakes', :with => {
  :category => 'Ruby'.to_crc32
}
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, this isn't amazingly clean, but it will work quite well. You should also take note that CRC32 encoding can have collisions, so it's not the perfect solution.

<h3 id="external_models">Models outside of @app/models@</h3>

If you're using plugins or other web frameworks (Radiant, Ramaze, etc) that don't always store their models in @app/models@, you can tell Thinking Sphinx to look in other locations when building the configuration file:

{% highlight ruby %}
ThinkingSphinx::Configuration.instance.
  model_directories << "/path/to/models/dir"
{% endhighlight %}

By default, Thinking Sphinx will load all models in @app/models@ and @vendor/plugins/*/app/models@.

<h3 id="bundler">Using Thinking Sphinx with Bundler</h3>

If you're using Thinking Sphinx with the gem manager Bundler, you will need to set the @:require@ option to thinking_sphinx.

{% highlight ruby %}
gem 'thinking-sphinx',
  :version => '1.3.17',
  :require => 'thinking_sphinx'
{% endhighlight %}

If this isn't done, it can introduce issues with gem loading order and script/console. And don't forget that you will still need to explicitly request the Thinking Sphinx tasks in your @Rakefile@:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx/tasks'
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="range_or">Mixing Ranged Filters and OR Logic</h3>

While Sphinx allows for querying with ranged filters on attributes, you can't have multiple filters joined by OR logic - all must match.

As a way around this, you might want to construct a SQL snippet which returns specific values for each range interval, and then filter by an array of values for the intervals you want. Check out "Tiago's solution on the Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/thinking-sphinx/msg/f022421e87a732bf.

This won't suit all situations, of course - if you don't have specific range intervals, then you're going to have to try something else.

<h3 id="escape_html">Removing HTML from Excerpts</h3>

For a while, Thinking Sphinx auto-escaped excerpts. However, Sphinx itself can remove HTML entities for indexing and excerpts, which is a better way to approach this. So, you'll want to add the following setting to your @sphinx.yml@ file:

{% highlight yaml %}
html_strip: true
{% endhighlight %}

<h3 id="other_adapters">Using other Database Adapters</h3>

If you're using Thinking Sphinx in combination with a database adapter that isn't quite run-of-the-mill, you may need to add a snippet of code to a Rails initialiser or equivalent (This is only available in versions 1.4.0 and 2.0.0 onwards, though).

Here's an example that covers things for Octopus:

{% highlight ruby %}
ThinkingSphinx.database_adapter = lambda do |model|
  case model.connection.config[:adapter]
  when 'mysql', 'mysql2'
    :mysql
  when 'postgresql'
    :postgresql
  else
    raise "You can only use Thinking Sphinx with MySQL or PostgreSQL"
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, @ThinkingSphinx.database_adapter@ accepts a symbol as well, if you just want to presume that you'll always be using either MySQL or PostgreSQL:

{% highlight ruby %}
ThinkingSphinx.database_adapter = :postgresql
{% endhighlight %}

In most situations, though, you shouldn't need to do this. Thinking Sphinx understands the standard MySQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL2, MySQL Plus and NullDB (as MySQL) adapters.

<h3 id="or_attributes">Using OR Logic with Attribute Filters</h3>

It is possible to filter on attributes using OR logic - although you need to be using Sphinx 0.9.9 or newer.

There's two steps to it... firstly, you need to create a computed attribute while searching, using Sphinx's select option, and then filter by that computed value. Here's an example where we want to return all publicly visible articles, as well as articles belonging to the user with an ID of 5.

{% highlight ruby %}
with_display = "*, IF(visible = 1 OR user_id = 5, 1, 0) AS display"
Article.search 'pancakes',
  :sphinx_select => with_display,
  :with          => {'display' => 1}
{% endhighlight %}

It's important to note that you'll want to include all existing attribute values by default (that's the @*@ at the start of the select). It's quite similar to standard SQL syntax.

For further reading, I recommend Sphinx's documentation on both "the select option":http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-0.9.9.html#api-func-setselect and "expression syntax":http://sphinxsearch.com/docs/manual-0.9.9.html#sort-expr.
