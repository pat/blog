h2. Testing with Thinking Sphinx

Before you get caught up in the specifics of testing Thinking Sphinx using certain tools, it's worth noting that no matter what the approach, you'll need to turn off transactional fixtures and index your data after creating the appropriate records - otherwise you won't get any search results.

Also: make sure you have your test environment using a different port number in @config/sphinx.yml@ (which you may need to create if you haven't already). If this isn't done, then you won't be able to run Sphinx in your development environment _and_ your tests at the same time (as they'll both want to use the same port for Sphinx).

{% highlight yaml %}
test:
  port: 9313
{% endhighlight %}

<ul>
  <li><a href="#unit_tests">Unit Tests and Specs</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cucumber">Cucumber</a></li>
  <li><a href="#functional">Rails Functional and Integration Tests</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="unit_tests">Unit Tests and Specs</h3>

It's recommended you stub out any search calls, as Thinking Sphinx should ideally only be used in integration testing (whether that be via Cucumber or other methods).

<h3 id="cucumber">Cucumber</h3>

As of version *1.3.2*, Thinking Sphinx has a helper object to make combining Thinking Sphinx and Cucumber quite easy. You'll need to add the following two lines to your @features/support/env.rb@ file:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'cucumber/thinking_sphinx/external_world'
Cucumber::ThinkingSphinx::ExternalWorld.new
{% endhighlight %}

Don't forget, you also _need_ to turn transactional fixtures off. This can be done on a global level in your @features/support/env.rb@ file:

{% highlight ruby %}
Cucumber::Rails::World.use_transactional_fixtures = false
{% endhighlight %}

Or, you can tag either an entire feature or single scenarios with the @@no-txn@ tag:

{% highlight gherkin %}
@no-txn
Feature: Searching for articles
{% endhighlight %}

The reason for this is that while ActiveRecord can run all its operations within a single transaction, Sphinx doesn't have access to that, and so indexing will not include your transaction's changes.

The added complication to this is that you'll probably want to clear all the data from your database between scenarios. This can be done within the @Before@ block, in one of your steps files (see below). Another option is Ben Mabey's "Database Cleaner":http://github.com/bmabey/database_cleaner library - and make sure you use the truncation strategy.

{% highlight ruby %}
Before do
  # Add your own models here instead.
  [Article, User].each do |model|
    model.delete_all
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

Once this is all set up, then Sphinx will automatically index and start the daemon when you run your features - but only once at the very beginning, not for every scenario (as that could be quite slow).

To re-index during specific scenarios, I recommend adding steps something like the following (to be called after preparing your model data, but before Webrat browses the application):

{% highlight ruby %}
Given 'the Sphinx indexes are updated' do
  # Update all indexes
  ThinkingSphinx::Test.index
  sleep(0.25) # Wait for Sphinx to catch up
end

Given 'the Sphinx indexes for articles are updated' do
  # Update specific indexes
  ThinkingSphinx::Test.index 'article_core', 'article_delta'
  sleep(0.25) # Wait for Sphinx to catch up
end
{% endhighlight %}

Delta indexes (if you're using the default approach) will automatically update just like they do in a normal application environment.

Any suggestions to improve this workflow are very much welcome.

<h3 id="functional">Rails Functional and Integration Tests</h3>

In much the same way, Thinking Sphinx can be used in traditional functional and integration tests. You'll want to add the following lines to your *test_helper.rb* file:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'thinking_sphinx/test'
ThinkingSphinx::Test.init
{% endhighlight %}

You can turn off transactional features on a per-test basis within the test class definition:

{% highlight ruby %}
class SearchControllerTest
  self.use_transactional_fixtures = false

  # ...
end
{% endhighlight %}

To actually have Sphinx running, you have a few options...

If you want it running constantly for _all_ of your tests, you can call @start_with_autostop@ in your @test_helper.rb@ file:

{% highlight ruby %}
ThinkingSphinx::Test.start_with_autostop
{% endhighlight %}

However, you probably don't want Sphinx running for your unit tests, and so it's recommended you just start and stop Sphinx as required. @ThinkingSphinx::Test@ has methods named @start@ and @stop@ for that very purpose:

{% highlight ruby %}
test "Searching for Articles" do
  ThinkingSphinx::Test.start

  get :index
  assert [@article], assigns[:articles]

  ThinkingSphinx::Test.stop
end
{% endhighlight %}

You can also wrap the code that needs Sphinx in a block called by @ThinkingSphinx::Test.run@, which will start up and stop Sphinx either side of the block:

{% highlight ruby %}
test "Searching for Articles" do
  ThinkingSphinx::Test.run do
    get :index
    assert [@article], assigns[:articles]
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

If you need to manually process indexes, just use the @index@ method, which defaults to all indexes unless you pass in specific names.

{% highlight ruby %}
ThinkingSphinx::Test.index # all indexes
ThinkingSphinx::Test.index 'article_core', 'article_delta'
{% endhighlight %}
