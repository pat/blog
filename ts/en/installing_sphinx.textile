h2. Installing Sphinx

h3. MacOS X

Sphinx _is_ available via MacPorts - but this comes with one important caveat: You must have MySQL and/or PostgreSQL installed via MacPorts as well. If you don't, then compiling by source is the best approach. "Download":http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html and try the following set of commands. _If you need PostgreSQL_ support though, scroll down and look at the UNIX section.

{% highlight sh %}
./configure
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

There are two common issues that people run into. The first is that iconv and/or the expat XML parser may need to be updated. Clinton Nixon has "written some clear instructions":http://www.viget.com/extend/installing-sphinx-on-os-x-leopard on how to handle that.

The other issue only appears when you actually index your data or start the daemon:

{% highlight sh %}
dyld: Library not loaded: \
  /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql/libmysqlclient.15.dylib
  Referenced from: /usr/local/bin/indexer
  Reason: image not found
{% endhighlight %}

A quick fix for this is to add a symlink from where the MySQL libraries are to where Sphinx expects them to be:

{% highlight sh %}
sudo ln -s /usr/local/mysql/lib /usr/local/mysql/lib/mysql
{% endhighlight %}

You may need to recompile and reinstall Sphinx once this is done.

h3. UNIX

If you're running Gentoo, then Sphinx is available via @portage@. Debian and Ubuntu have the @sphinxsearch@ package available to them in apt. I don't know what the status is for other distributions and package management tools, so you may need to compile it yourself.

Compiling by source should be quite painless though. "Download the code":http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html from the Sphinx website - version 0.9.8.1 is the most recent stable release at the moment. The standard set of commands should install it with MySQL support:

{% highlight sh %}
./configure
make
sudo make install
{% endhighlight %}

If you need PostgreSQL support, you'll need to tell the Sphinx configuration step that. It could be as simple as a flag:

{% highlight sh %}
./configure --with-pgsql
{% endhighlight %}

But in some cases the path to the libraries will need to be explicitly set:

{% highlight sh %}
./configure --with-pgsql=/usr/local/include/postgresql
{% endhighlight %}

The libraries path can be determined by running the following command:

{% highlight sh %}
pg_config --pkgincludedir
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Windows

If you're installing Sphinx on Windows, then all you should have to do is grab "the relevant installer":http://www.sphinxsearch.com/downloads.html from the Sphinx website (one has PostgreSQL and MySQL support, one is just for MySQL). Install, and you're good to go.
