h2. Indexing your Models

Everything to set up the indexes for your models goes in the *define_index* method, within your model.

{% highlight ruby %}
class Article < ActiveRecord::Base
  # @...@
  
  define_index do
    indexes subject, :sortable => true
    indexes content
    indexes author(:name), :as => :author, :sortable => true
    
    has author_id, created_at, updated_at
  end
  
  # @...@
end
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Fields

The *indexes* method adds one (or many) fields, by referencing the model's column names.

{% highlight ruby %}
indexes content
{% endhighlight %}

Keep in mind that if you're referencing a column that shares its name with a core Ruby method (such as id, name or type), then you'll need to specify it using a symbol.

{% highlight ruby %}
indexes :name
{% endhighlight %}

You don't need to keep the same names as the database, though. Use the *:as* option to signify an alias.

{% highlight ruby %}
indexes content, :as => :post
{% endhighlight %}

You can also flag fields as being sortable.

{% highlight ruby %}
indexes subject, :sortable => true
{% endhighlight %}

If there are associations in your model, you can drill down through them to access other columns. Explicit aliases are _required_ when doing this.

{% highlight ruby %}
indexes author(:name), :as => :author
indexes author.location, :as => :author_location
{% endhighlight %}

There may be times when a normal column value isn't exactly what you're after, so you can also define your indexes as raw SQL:

notextile.. {% highlight ruby %}
indexes "LOWER(first_name)", :as => :first_name, :sortable => true
{% endhighlight %}

p. Again, in this situation, an explicit alias is required.

h3. Attributes

The *has* method adds one (or many) attributes, and just like the *indexes* method, it requires references to the model's column names.

{% highlight ruby %}
has author_id
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax is very similar to setting up fields. You can set aliases, and drill down into associations. You don't ever need to label an attribute as *:sortable* though - in Sphinx, all attributes can be used for sorting.

{% highlight ruby %}
has tags(:id), :as => :tag_ids
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Conditions and Groupings

Because the index is translated to SQL, you may want to add some custom conditions or groupings manually - and for that, you'll want the @where@ and @group_by@ methods:

{% highlight ruby %}
define_index do
  # @...@
  
  where "status = 'active'"
  
  group_by "user_id"
end
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Processing your Index

Once you've got your index set up just how you like it, you can run "the rake task":rake_tasks.html to get Sphinx to process the data.

{% highlight sh %}
rake thinking_sphinx:index
{% endhighlight %}

As each model is processed, you will see a message much like the one below. It is just a warning, not an error. Everything will work fine.

{% highlight sh %}
distributed index 'article' can not be directly indexed; skipping.
{% endhighlight %}

However, if you have made structural changes to your index (which is anything except adding new data into the database tables), you'll need to stop Sphinx, re-index, and then re-start Sphinx.

{% highlight sh %}
rake thinking_sphinx:stop
rake thinking_sphinx:index
rake thinking_sphinx:start
{% endhighlight %}
