h2. Thinking Sphinx

*Using Rails 3?* Thinking Sphinx 2 (currently a prerelease) supports Rails 3 only - "here's the lowdown on how to get it set up":rails3.html.

h3. What?

A concise and easy-to-use Ruby library that connects ActiveRecord to the "Sphinx":http://sphinxsearch.com search daemon, managing configuration and searching.

h3. Why?

Sphinx is a very fast search engine that indexes data and provides flexible ways of searching it. Thinking Sphinx allows you to link up your models into Sphinx simply and painlessly -– because let’s face it, searching across multiple fields using SQL is a pain in the neck.

h3. Where?

Read up on "installing Sphinx":installing_sphinx.html and "then Thinking Sphinx":installing_thinking_sphinx.html.

h3. Who?

"Pat Allan":http://freelancing-gods.com is the developer behind Thinking Sphinx, and the underlying API for Sphinx, "Riddle":http://riddle.freelancing-gods.com. Many others have contributed valued patches and ideas.

h3. Most importantly: How?

Read "the quickstart guide":quickstart.html, along with the rest of the documentation.

And when you get stuck, there's always "the google group":http://groups.google.com/group/thinking-sphinx/.
