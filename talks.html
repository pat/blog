<p>I've had the privilege to speak at a variety of events - and sometimes these talks are recorded (or I've written up notes) - and then I can list them here. Hopefully they're useful and/or interesting!</p>

<p>Though it's also worth noting: the videos here are from 2011 through to 2023 - I've learnt a considerable amount of not just technical knowledge but also power, privilege, and my place in the world. There are definitely some things I've said in talks years ago that I would not say now, and things I would emphasise differently. But that's a good thing - I always want to be learning.</p>

  <figcaption>I have given this talk twice - the first time at RubyConf AU in Narrm/Melbourne, Australia, February 2023, and then at RailsConf in Atlanta, Georgia, USA, May 2023. The video above is the first of these, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2u1kZ-qeDkA">the second</a> is adjusted for an American audience.</figcaption>

  <figcaption>I was very lucky to present this talk a few times: at <a href="http://rubynation2016.herokuapp.com">RubyNation</a> in Arlington VA, USA, June 2016, at <a href="http://2016.deccanrubyconf.org">Deccan RubyConf</a> in Pune, India, August 2016, at <a href="http://rubyconf.pt">RubyConf Portugal</a> in Braga, Portugal, October 2016, and at <a href="http://rubyconf.org.au/2017">RubyConf AU</a> in Melbourne, Australia, February 2017. The video above is from the last of those.</figcaption>

<p>Never liked the title - if I had the chance to do this talk again, I'd rename it to Refactoring Community.</p>
