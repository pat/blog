### Context

The fourth Australian [Rails Camp](http://railscamps.com) happened back
in the middle of November - and it was unsurprisingly and extremely
enjoyably awesome, just like the previous four. **Ryan** and **Anthony**
did a sterling job with putting it all together.

I probably talked a bit too much - I certainly felt I had more than my
fair share of peoples’ focus - and while I rabbited on about Sphinx and
[Ginger](http://github.com/freelancing-god/ginger), the topic I really
enjoyed ranting about was freelancing, because it became far less about
me, and far more about sharing the wealth of everybody’s experiences. I
provided a few starting points, and then wise
[RORO](http://faces.rubyonrails.com.au/) minds added their own thoughts
and opinions.

I can’t reproduce all that here, though. I wouldn’t do it justice. What
I can do is go over the same notes I had then, and you can add your 2
cents (or five dollars) in the comments.

### Freelancing Maths

One of the first things you need to be aware of, when you start
freelancing, is how much to charge. I didn’t have a clue, but some more
business-minded friends put me on the right track, so I’m sharing their
advice here - don’t give me any credit for it.

So, let’s assume you want to start freelancing, and you have a target of
earning $80,000 over the year (yes, some of you may say that’s too low,
but others will say it’s too high - it’s just an example, okay?). You
can use this as a basis for figuring out an hourly rate. There’s **52**
weeks in a year, **5** days in a week, and **8** hours in a day…

     52 weeks
    x 5  days
    x 8 hours
    x ?  rate
    _________
       80,000

But wait a second - are you really going to work all of those 52 weeks?
I doubt it. You’ll need time off for annual leave, sick leave and public
holidays - the times when an employer would still pay you when you’re
not slaving away. Australian annual leave is **four** weeks, sick leave
is usually **two**, let’s add in another **one** for public holidays,
and that brings us down to **45**.

     45 weeks
    x 5  days
    x 8 hours
    x ?  rate
    _________
       80,000

What are the odds you’re going to have work all the time though, and are
you really going to have **eight** billable hours each day? Unless
you’re some sort of machine, the answer’s no, trust me. So lets drop
**eight** down to **six**.

         45 weeks
    x     5  days
    x     6 hours
    x 59.25  rate
    _____________
           80,000

One thing we’ve missed in our calculations is superannuation. Again,
using Australia as the example (because it’s all I can reliably comment
on), you’re supposed to be putting away **9%** of your income into your
super account. Let’s factor that in:

         45 weeks
    x     5  days
    x     6 hours
    x 64.59  rate
    _____________
           87,200

Okay, so we can get an hourly rate of about **$65** from that maths. And
that could be fine… but maybe you’ve been eyeing off
[RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/) or
[RubyConf](http://2008.rubyconf.org/) or other such events. They’re not
cheap - and hopefully employers would normally fork out the cash to get
you there. You’re the employer now, so how are you going to afford it?
Add an allowance into your calculations.

Again, due to the remoteness of Australia, it’s extra expensive to get
to any of the major Ruby conferences. If we assume you’ll get to two of
them (again, could be extravagant for some of you, but this is all
hypothetical), then I’m adding a touch over $12,000 - flights, hotels,
insurance, the conference tickets - to bring us to a nice round $100,000
target.

Also, I’ve dropped the number of weeks down another **two** - it’s not
like you’ll be getting anything done for your clients as you jet around.

         43 weeks
    x     5  days
    x     6 hours
    x 77.52  rate
    _____________
          100,000

Okay, our final hourly rate is about **$77.50**.

I know a lot of the more experienced developers are looking at that
value and thinking it’s pretty low - and going by market rates (for Ruby
developers), it’s definitely below average. Some say a good ballpark
figure for a decent Rails developer is $100/hour - USD or AUD (remember
when the two currencies were almost on par?). This doesn’t mean you
should charge that much (or that little) - but it should factor into
your thinking.

All that said, you need to be comfortable with what you’re billing your
time at, but don’t be afraid to charge what you’re worth. If the idea of
having more cash than you expect scares you, there’s plenty of charities
who would like to be your friend. Or, you could just work less, and
spend the extra time on cool things (and they don’t even have to involve
code!)

### Freelancing Profile

Knowing what to charge is useful, but it’s not going to bring in the
clients. Being known will help that problem, though - and there’s a few
things you can do to help that.

#### Blog

Interpret how you will - a normal blog, twitter, tumblelog, even gists
and pasties - sharing your ideas and knowledge is a great way to get
your name known to others. It also helps build some human connections,
via comments, emails or directed tweets. If it is valuable, they will
find you (and if you think they need help, use a site like
[RubyFlow](http://rubyflow.com/) or [RubyCorner](http://rubycorner.com/)
to bring in some eyeballs).

#### Talk

If there’s a neat bit of code you’ve found, library you’ve come across
(or written), or knowledge you think is valuable to others, offer to
talk about it! It can be at your local Ruby group, or at something like
a Rails Camp or BarCamp, or if you’re really comfortable up on stage,
think about applying for a RailsConf or RubyConf slot.

I’m not a natural public speaker - but my confidence has grown in leaps
and bounds from giving talks to fellow developers. Granted, I need to
build up a bigger repertoire of topics, but I’m a bit less nervous about
standing up and announcing my thoughts and opinions to others. It all
started with an email from [Tim Lucas](http://toolmantim.com/) asking
what I was going to talk about at the first Rails Camp - and now Rails
Camp folks are probably sick of hearing my voice.

They know who I am, though, and they know what code I’ve written. And
that’s led to a referral or two for Rails work (usually Sphinx-related).

#### Socialise

Networking is a dirty word - and I can see how building connections with
others for the purpose of connections, instead of meeting cool people,
is a bit dirty. The much more fun alternative is to socialise - go out
to social events, find those drinks happening in the evenings of
conferences, have a conversation with a person you’ve not met before at
your local Ruby meet.

Down the track, you will find these people may throw work your way - or
maybe you’ll just learn cool new ways to code, or share some of your own
knowledge, or make a good friend. All chalked up as wins in my book.

#### Release Code

Releasing your own code - from snippets to plug ins to full-blown
applications - is a great way to show peers that you know what you’re
talking about. It also shows potential clients that too, and reaffirms
that you’re worth the rate you’re charging, and that you can be
creative.

In my own case, I’ve done the occasional bit of Sphinx consulting due to
my work on [Thinking Sphinx](http://ts.freelancing-gods.com).

Coincidentally, doing all these things are rewarding in and of
themselves. I don’t do them to bring in work, I do them because they’re
fun and I meet awesome people, which is (I think) the best approach. The
opportunities they lead to are just an added bonus.

### Your Turn

So, what’s your advice to a budding freelancer? Is there anything here
that’s a bit Ruby or developer-centric? Any more general suggestions to
keep in mind?

Also, please keep in mind I’m not an expert. I think the above advice is
useful, but it is just advice. There’s no hard and fast rules that
should be followed.

And the name of this blog has nothing to do with my work lifestyle, but
the idea of deities who freelance for each other. Don’t take it as an
indication of my ego. Honest.

One of my advice would be: never ever take projects with hour rate less
then you normally want to have.

Pat:  
How do you count hours needed for the project? I had some projects, when
real work hours number was much greater than what I’ve expected… It’s
hardest part of project for me. If you say too much client will go
somewhere else, if you say too low you will end up with extra not
billable hours.

Another fact is that programmers (especially beginners) will often
underestimate the time needed for project…

Awesome post. One thing I think you’ve overlooked (I certainly know
**I** did for a while when freelancing) was the overhead of
quotes/proposals/estimates.

I ended up factoring in a few hours a week for that too. Some jobs
required nothing more than a handshake, others required a bit of upfront
work that wasn’t really billable to anyone but myself.

Piotr: Good point re: rates.

I’m almost always involved in an hour-by-hour basis - rarely do I have
to estimate upfront (occasionally by feature, but that’s about it), so I
don’t have much experience there.

Indeed, I’ve only been freelancing for two years now, so it’s not like I
have loads of experience generally.

Justin: you’re right. I also forgot to allow money and time to manage
finances - either figuring out GST yourself. And I’m sure in other
fields there’s other time overheads I’ve not factored in.

Excellent advice. I would add getting published (outside your blog) as
another solid way of getting recognition and leading to referrals.  
Writing a book is definitely not for everyone but there are more
accessible avenues including Peepcode mini-books or (shameless plug) the
excellent upcoming Rails Magazine.

I pretty much just assume that however long I think a project will take,
it will actually take 25% longer.

Good write up!

Someone used a rule of “double the estimate, add 10%, and double the
estimate again”. While quite, er, extreme, it’s remarkably true of quite
a few projects, especially large ones, especially when an external team
is involved—feature creep, scope creep, HR creep all take quite a hard
hit on estimating prowess.

Justin:

One way I deal with this is to charge for estimates but refund the
amount if the project goes ahead; it puts an end to the time wasters who
don’t have serious intent, and it deals fairly with those who want a
good proposal/estimate before making a decision and therefore should be
willing to pay for the skill and time involved in producing such a
proposal. And if they then decide to go ahead with contract with you
then they get a credit so it’s good for them and good for you (since you
got the contract you wanted).

Of course this only works if the time is a few hours to a few days - if
it’s a significantly more complex proposal then the time just has to be
charged for upfront and not credited even if they do go ahead with your
services.

Such a shame about the aussie dollar taking a nose dive recently. I hope
that scrambles out of the gutter soon.

You might also need to factor in expenses such as hardware, software
updates, office expenses, accountant and rental fees.

Regarding quotes, I personally don’t do “fixed bid quotes”, or accept
jobs that require them. You can usually negotiate on this, unless it’s
an industry savy client that wants to squeeze you to maximize their own
profits and you’re best to steer clear of those “bottom of the barrel”
types clients.

The quote is only an estimate as outlined in the terms and conditions
submitted with the bid. The actual amount can vary significantly,
depending a number of factors, such as scope creep, which isn’t
necessarily a bad thing if you’re working closely with a client.

Hi everyone,

I’m not really a freelancer, but more of a consultant contracted to
different companies for extended periods of time. A handy rule to use
for such longer periods of time is the rule of 3rds.

Most consultants split their revenue 3 ways. Profit, Expenses and
Salary. Believe me, when you get started you think the hourly rate will
suffice really well. “Wow! You think…100k in a year!” Cash flow,
invoicing issues and many other little problems (largely) always seems
to spring up. As such, you could probably safely assume that your 100k
is actually delivering you any useful wage somewhere closer to 40k.
Increase your wage 30% to cover for these sorts of things. (Thus,
Expenses + Profit)

If you’re freelancing business is going really well, and the only way to
get through the great work is to bring someone else on begin charging
33% more again (salary) to pay for someone else to come on board.

I know that’s a little more “how to build your business” rather than
Freelance advice, but I found it really useful. This is the environment
you are playing in - don’t forget how talented you are and realise that
for all the work you do there is an established consulting house doing
the same stuff for triple the price.

Finally, once you have your rate, you should spin it into a day-rate + a
half-day rate. Don’t get caught going to see a client for 1 hour, and
losing travel time and half a day from your schedule. Block your time.
If the client wants to see you, go there for the half day or day. And if
they only need you for an hour, still charge for the half-day. We all
know those 10am meetings kill productivity like nothing else.

Great post Pat, and great conversation![]()!

Agree with much of what’s been said - excellent knowledge share.

Fixed Bids: These can be fine if a very clear spec is in place.
Sometimes a new client wants this because they don’t know you yet, and
are reticent to have you billing hourly and piling up costs without
making sufficient progress. With a fixed bid, assume that there will,
even with a good spec, be some extra work involved that is unspec’d … so
I always add ~30% time on. The nice thing about a fixed bid is that 30%
…if all goes well you may end up getting more for the project than the
hourly. That’s risk/reward of fixed bids. But I never would do one where
there’s a fuzzy unfinished spec.

Perspective: I think it’s really important to try to see yourself as a
new client would. This is first and foremost the sum total of your web
“presence”, and your resume. This is where a blog can add so much value…
it’s a free zone for you to add spice, dimension to the impression
someone is trying to get when considering you. A fully fledged LinkedIn
profile is also very important. Get recommendations from key past
associates, clients etc. As stated above comment on other blogs and get
to know other consultants.

Ubiquity: keep a constant eye on job boards, and send resumes
consistently, looking ahead several months. You may not get a gig but
make a connection that comes in use later. There’s no cost to sending
out your resume and blog url etc.

Perform Beyond the Call of Duty: The single best thing you can do for
your hire-ability is do an better than excellent job on everything. The
lion-share of work comes from repeats and referrals ..once that ball
starts rolling along you can start turning down gigs and raising rates,
as long as you deliver this level of quality and communication.

I thought I’d throw in an idea about pricing options for development
work.

I’ll also put up front that I’m not a freelancer; I come from one of
those consultancy companies Steve refers to … although the chance to
charge out at 3 x $77.52 per hour would be nice; I can’t say I’ve
managed it yet :-(

Anyway, last year when looking into how best to structure commerical
agreements for Agile Development work, I came across the idea of Target
Priced Contracts.

The concept is that fixed price contracts mean the developer wears all
the risk and therefore will need to add a buffer to mitigate the risk
(ie. 30% on top, or the other multipliers described above).

Rather than take that approach, this method shares the risk between the
client and the developer…

Once the work is scoped and an agreed set of deliverables defined, a
price is set based on your reasonable estimate of durations (the target
price, based on your daily rate). This price is signed off on by the
customer. For the example, lets say 10 days, $750 per day, target price
$7500.

During the project, rather than pay your full rate, they pay your ‘cost’
along the way. In our situation, thats the salary of the developer plus
a little to cover overheads. For freelancers, its the rent plus enough
to feed yourself and cover general expenses. (for the example, lets say
$300 per day)

This will naturally leave a gap between what you’re paid and what the
target price is (10 x $300 = $3,000 :- final payment is $4,500). If the
contract finishes on time, then this is the amount the client pays you
at the end and we’re all happy.

If you are outstanding and find faster ways of completing the work and
finish ahead of time (say 8 days), the client still pays that amount.
They’re happy because they paid less overall for the project (8 x 300 +
4,500 = $6,900) and you’re happy because you made the same amount of
profit for less work ($4,500 for 8 days work instead of 10) and can get
onto the next project

If however there is scope creep, things get tricky, something goes wrong
and it takes longer than 10 days (say 12 days) then the client continues
to pay your costs until you’re finished (an additional 2 x 300), but
only pays the same final payment ($4,500).

So, they pay more (12 x 300 + 4,500 = 8,100) and your profit margin goes
down (4,500 profit out of 8,100 total payment instead of 4,500 out of
7,500). So, you both feel some pain, but its not unfairly felt by either
party.

This means that both parties are focussed on getting a good result -
clear requirements, efficient delivery.

Its turned into a long post … sorry! Hopefully it fuels some idea’s and
further thought for everyone though.

Good post! I’m pretty sure that a lot of freelance developers have
already seen Freelance Switch’s rates calculator, but just in case, it’s
similar to the above, but it does the math for you, and has a few extra
items you may not have thought about.

Great post, many things to consider.

You may be aware of a completely different approach used by many
consulting firms: the multiplier. For example, when I was running such a
firm, we took the billable employee’s pay rate (say, $40/hour) and
multiplied by 3 to get the billing rate ($120/hour). It is loosely
rationalized as 1/3 for the employee, 1/3 for various other costs borne
by the company (vacation, sick, bench time, etc.), and 1/3 for profit.

Multipliers range from about 2 to about 4.

Easy way to get a gut check.
