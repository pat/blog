The monthly Melbourne Ruby meeting is happening this Thursday, and I'll be presenting about Rails' caching (of the page, action and fragment varieties). Just wondering if any of the few readers of this blog had either suggestions for content, or, especially, questions they'd like to see addressed in such a talk?

Slides will, of course, be posted after the meeting.
