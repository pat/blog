Another quick Comedy Festival show review - *The Hound of the
Baskervilles*’ **Every Film Ever Made**. A chaotic hour of film
references and banter, which is extremely entertaining, if a bit
scattered.

The same three local comedians (Tegan Higginbotham, Adam McKenzie, and
Rob Lloyd) performed an adaption of the film version of The Hound of the
Baskervilles in a similar style at last year’s festival, and they’re
just as delightful this time around. Probably useful knowing a decent
portion of well known films though (like The Lord of the Rings, Star
Wars, The Godfather, Casablanca, Titanic, Back to the Future, and, err,
8 Mile).

Definitely worth seeing if you can spare the time - and it’s always good
to support some local up-and-coming acts. I wouldn’t say it’s
*brilliant*, but it’s a *massive* amount of fun.
