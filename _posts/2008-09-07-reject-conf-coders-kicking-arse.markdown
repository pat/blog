One of the highlights from RailsConf EU last week was RejectConf - even
if it was a bit smaller than last year (going by what I’ve heard,
anyway).

I reprised my [So You’re A Kick-Arse
Coder](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/so_you%27re_a_kick_arse_coder)
talk for it - since it was a rejected talk from the main event - and
[Geoffrey Grosenbach](http://topfunky.com/) managed to get an audio
recording, so I’ve put that together with the slides and onto
[Viddler](http://www.viddler.com/explore/Freelancing_god/videos/4/).
Keep in mind the following caveats:

-   I’m pretty happy with this talk - but I realise I’m not that great
    a speaker. Imagine what I’d be like on a bad day ;)
-   Geoff didn’t catch the very start of the talk, which went something
    along the lines of “Hi, my name’s Pat, and I’m Australian \[Cheers
    from Audience\] I want to start of with some flattery, because I
    want to get on your good side.”
-   Geoff’s also the heckler about two-thirds of the way though.

Great talk!

Love the way you gave people a bunch of different scopes in which to
think about the problem.

I think it’s great the way you’ve adapted your concept and talk to suit
your target audience. Totally impressed.

Keep up the great work!

Pete: Thanks - it’s been how I’ve generally structured it, but this is
the first time I’ve made it explicit.

Nathan: Thanks - and yeah, each version of the talk I’ve done has been
slightly different, depending on the audience. I think it’s time to come
up with a completely new talk though :)
