Another week has passed, so time for some more "LaughTrack":http://laughtrack.com.au statistics.

First up, acts with the best ratings improvements since the start of the Festival:

| "Nelly Thomas: I Coulda Been A Sailor":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/249 |   0 |  72 |  72 |

That list is almost identical (ignoring the order) to last week... essentially: those who did well to start with, have solidified their position.

So let's look at the differences just in the last week instead.

|_. Show |_. Initial Rating |_. Current Rating |_. Difference |
| "List Operators For Kids: More Fun Than a Wii":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/215 |   0 |  60 |  60 |

| "Nick Cody: Lust Actually":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/251 |   0 |  43 |  43 |

This list could be considered shows with potential: towards the end, it only took two positive tweets to get them onto the list.

So, let's now look at who has garnered the most positive tweets. Again, since the start of the festival:

|_. Show |_. Initial Count |_. Current Count |_. Difference |
| "Wil Anderson: Wilful Misconduct":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/371 | 11 | 42 | 31 |
| "Arj Barker: Let Me Do The Talking":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/24 | 23 | 43 | 20 |
| "Good Evening: Shaun Micallef & Stephen Curry":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/141 |  0 | 19 | 19 |
| "The Pajama Men: The Last Stand to Reason":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/265 |  7 | 26 | 19 |
| "Rich Fulcher: Eleanor the Tour Whore":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/292 |  5 | 23 | 18 |
| "Nina Conti: Talk to the Hand":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/255 | 13 | 30 | 17 |
| "Celia Pacquola: Flying Solos":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/57 |  0 | 14 | 14 |
| "Ursula Martinez: My Stories Your Emails":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/366 |  0 | 14 | 14 |
| "Tom Green: World Standup Comedy Tour":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/349 |  8 | 22 | 14 |
| "Tim Key: The Slutcracker":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/340 | 19 | 32 | 13 |
| "Melinda Buttle: Sista Got Flow":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/234 |  4 | 17 | 13 |

Some big names there, though good to see some relative newcomers appearing too (Ursula Martinez, Melinda Buttle and Celia Pacquola).

As for the increases over just the last week:

|_. Show |_. Initial Count |_. Current Count |_. Difference |
| "Wil Anderson: Wilful Misconduct":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/371 | 17 | 42 | 25 |
| "Arj Barker: Let Me Do The Talking":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/24 | 25 | 43 | 18 |
| "Tom Green: World Standup Comedy Tour":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/349 | 8 | 22 | 14 |
| "Good Evening: Shaun Micallef & Stephen Curry":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/141 | 9 | 19 | 10 |
| "Ursula Martinez: My Stories Your Emails":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/366 | 5 | 14 |  9 |
| "The Pajama Men: The Last Stand to Reason":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/265 | 17 | 26 |  9 |
| "Nina Conti: Talk to the Hand":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/255 | 21 | 30 |  9 |
| "Frank Woodley: Bewilderbeest":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/133 | 19 | 27 |  8 |
| "Sammy J and Randy: Ricketts Lane":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/307 | 6 | 14 |  8 |
| "Melinda Buttle: Sista Got Flow":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/234 | 9 | 17 |  8 |

Not much difference in the names this time around...

But what can you take away from this?

* "Ursula Martinez":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/366 was an unknown before this festival. She's just added three extra shows, which matches the buzz she's received.
* "Melinda Buttle":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/234 is another festival newcomer who has been getting a lot of buzz.
* The big names draw the tweets - but "Wil Anderson":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/371 and "Tom Green":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/349 have both finished their festival runs.
* "The Pajama Men":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/265 won the Barry Award for the best show last year in their first festival, and they've followed it up with another fine offering, going by numbers (and reviews).

I've also started tracking which performances are sold out - but there's no point offering stats on that, because my data is far from complete. However, some of the smaller names regularly selling out:

* "Celia Pacquola":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/57
* "Hannah Gadsby":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/151
* "Anne Edmonds":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/20
* "The Bedroom Philosopher":http://laughtrack.com.au/shows/34

Nick Cody, Daniel Burt, Vigilantelope and Clodhopper: Miami all sold quite well too - but they've finished their runs.
