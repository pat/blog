Another quick Comedy Festival show review - _The Hound of the Baskervilles_' *Every Film Ever Made*. A chaotic hour of film references and banter, which is extremely entertaining, if a bit scattered.

The same three local comedians (Tegan Higginbotham, Adam McKenzie, and Rob Lloyd) performed an adaption of the film version of The Hound of the Baskervilles in a similar style at last year's festival, and they're just as delightful this time around. Probably useful knowing a decent portion of well known films though (like The Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, The Godfather, Casablanca, Titanic, Back to the Future, and, err, 8 Mile).

Definitely worth seeing if you can spare the time - and it's always good to support some local up-and-coming acts. I wouldn't say it's _brilliant_, but it's a _massive_ amount of fun.
