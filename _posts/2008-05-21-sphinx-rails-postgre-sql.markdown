In case you’ve not been watching every commit carefully flow through
[Thinking Sphinx on
GitHub](http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tree/master) -
PostgreSQL support has been added. I’ve done a little bit of testing,
and I’ve had some excellent support from Björn Andreasson and [Tim
Riley](http://log.openmonkey.com/), so I feel it’s ready for people to
start kicking the tires.

I’m no PostgreSQL expert - I definitely fall into the n00b category - so
if you think there’s better ways to do what I’m doing, would love to
hear them.
