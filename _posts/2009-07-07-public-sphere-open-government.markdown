I’m a bit late to blogging about this (and I realise there’s plenty of
other blog posts I should have written over the last few months), but a
couple of weeks ago, the ACT Senator [Kate
Lundy](http://www.katelundy.com.au/) and her advisor Pia Waugh ran their
second Public Sphere event. I didn’t really hear of the first one -
focused on [the national broadband
network](http://www.katelundy.com.au/category/campaigns/publicsphere/high-speed-bandwidth/)
- until after it happened. The second’s topic was [open government (or
the more buzzword-friendly Government
2.0)](http://www.katelundy.com.au/category/campaigns/publicsphere/open-gov/),
a topic I’m passionate about, and so I marked it in my calendar.

Of course, the event took place in Canberra, and I’m currently
experimenting with a
[location-independant](http://www.dopplr.com/traveller/FreelancingGod/public)
life at the moment, and was in Boston, Massachusetts at the time.
However, there was a live video feed for the talks, and the twitter
hashtag
[\#publicsphere](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23publicsphere) was
massively popular. I was able to listen in for a good part of the day,
and throw around some comments with others paying attention.

### Reflection

There was a *lot* of talking. I probably caught about half the talks,
and was feeling pretty braindead when I called it a night. I imagine
those there would have found it a little tough, particularly with the
addition of corridor discussions.

It was great to see not only Senator Lundy speaking, but Lindsay Tanner
and Joe Ludwig as well - *and* generally saying the right things. By all
appearances, they seem to understand the need for openness and
transparency.

It will be interesting to see how all this talk translates into action
though.

### The Taskforce

Not that there isn’t action happening, mind you - a good portion of the
talks were about what people were already doing. The big announcement
from the event was the creation of a [Government 2.0
Taskforce](http://gov2.net.au/), which seems to be made up of some smart
people. Mind you, their banner competition seems to be a small token
towards the having an open and collaborative dialog.

I’m also hoping they can sidestep the bureacracy that so often ties
governments down, and get things done fast and effectively. Given
they’ve only got six months to make things happen, there’s a decent
chance.

### Disconnect

The event gave me some hope where little has been in the past. However,
this drive towards open data and transparency doesn’t gel too nicely
with the approach of Senator Conroy, who is the Minister for
Communication. Why wasn’t he present?

That said, the proposed filter legislation sticks out like a sore thumb,
so it’s fair to say he wouldn’t have received a particularly warm
welcome. Something needs to change, though - personally, I’d love to see
Kate Lundy take over his portfolio, but I’m not holding my breath.

Also, Lindsay Tanner really seemed to have his head around the open
government space, and it sounded like that’s been the case for a while -
so why are we only seeing actions like this now?

### From a Distance

Finally, a few notes on how I found interacting with the event from
afar.

-   Having a video feed is fantastic - far better than purely relying on
    live-blogging or Twitter
-   The twitter stream **is** great at providing a picture for others’
    takes on what is being said.
-   Unsurprisingly, the timezone made it a challenge - I missed out on
    most of the afternoon sessions (around 2AM local time).
-   I also missed out on the informal discussions, in the breaks and
    corridors, which is where I feel a lot of the value usually is in
    conferences and unconferences.

I’m definitely looking forward to seeing both recommendations and
actions from the Taskforce, as well as future Public Sphere events.

There’s going to be at least one more (planned for the end of this month
or sometime in August, last I heard) on local ICT industry growth and
development.

Worth tuning into? Depends how passionate and interested you are about
the topics. Definitely worth keeping an eye on.
