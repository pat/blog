At a recent Melbourne Ruby meet, I was asked to speak about my travelling freelancer lifestyle, and "the talk was recorded":http://vimeo.com/8350739. I feel a little self-conscious about the topic, but perhaps you'll find it interesting.

Massive thanks to James Healy for not only recording the talks that night, but producing the neat slides-and-video output. I'm looking forward to "the Melbourne Ruby channel":http://vimeo.com/channels/melbourneruby building up a good collection of sessions.

Also: I'll be posting a review of my month working on Thinking Sphinx soon.
