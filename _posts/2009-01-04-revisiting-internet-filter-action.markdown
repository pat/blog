So, a bit over a year ago, as we edged closer and closer to voting John
Howard out of office, Rudd’s team make the stupid election promise of an
internet filter. Exactly a year ago, in anger and frustration, [I sent
off a
letter](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/internet_censorship_in_australia)
to Stephen Conroy, the then new Minister for Broadband, Communications
and the Digital Economy.

Twelve months later, what have we learnt?

-   Conroy is [slow to respond to
    letters](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/correspondance_on_censorship).
-   Conroy isn’t particularly good at engaging in reasoned discourse.
-   Conroy *is* good at staying on message.
-   The internet filter is unlikely to be completely opt-out - there’ll
    just be two levels.
-   Question Time [is a
    farce](http://www.somebodythinkofthechildren.com/question-time-turns-into-conroy-comedy-club-question-dodging-at-its-worst/)
    and lacking in intelligent discussion.
-   Those passionate about the issue have
    [mobilised](http://www.abc.net.au/unleashed/stories/s2406365.htm),
    with the [EFA](http://nocleanfeed.com/),
    [GetUp](http://www.getup.org.au/campaign/SaveTheNet/442), [Steve
    Hopkins](http://www.rosshill.com.au/article/the-rudd-filter-has-been-phone-bombed/)
    and [Elias Bizannes](http://siliconbeachaustralia.org/ruddfilter/)
    amongst those leading the way.
-   Trials of internet filters have focused [mainly on HTTP and HTTPS
    traffic](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/filtering_trial_results).
    Not IM, peer-to-peer traffic, or newsgroups.
-   ISPs, including
    [iiNet](http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2008/11/11/1226318639085.html?page=fullpage)
    and Internode, are not fans of the proposed legislation
-   The Greens and Liberals aren’t supporting it either. Nick Xenephon
    seems to be on the fence, and unsurprisingly Stephen Fielding of
    Family First wants to add legal content to be blocked by the filter.
-   Conroy insists that our filter will be much like those in Sweden and
    Canada - yet both of those filters, according to the Government’s
    [own feasibility
    study](http://www.dbcde.gov.au/communications_for_consumers/funding_programs__and__support/cyber-safety_plan/internet_service_provider_isp_filtering/),
    are voluntary.
-   There is a [live
    pilot](http://www.dbcde.gov.au/communications_for_consumers/funding_programs__and__support/cyber-safety_plan/internet_service_provider_isp_filtering/isp_filtering_live_pilot) underway.

We’ve had petitions, rallies, phone bombs, emails and letters. It
doesn’t seem to be making a dint in Conroy’s plans. I think face-to-face
meetings is the best way forward. If your local member is from the ALP,
then meet with them. If they’re not, you will have a Senator who is. If
you’re uncomfortable about going alone, find some other like-minded
souls. A group may well have a larger impact.

If you’re in Melbourne, that’s where Stephen Conroy is based - I’d love
to hear some feedback of anyone who has met with him. I’m currently
overseas, so I haven’t got around to that yet - I’ve only managed to
meet with my then-local member (I’ve since changed electorates), and it
was pretty clear that I knew more about the issue than he did.

I’d also recommend not bothering with arguments relating to civil
liberties, censorship or [keeping legal access to
pornography](http://flickr.com/photos/misrt/2990444801/in/pool-nocleanfeed/).
While I don’t disagree that these are important and valid, it’s not
going to win over anyone. Personally, I try to keep the message about
how the filter isn’t going to work, just like past filters haven’t
worked, and thus it’s a waste of money and time. You need to express
understanding that the Government’s goal is laudable, but the approach
isn’t. The ends does not justify the means.

Also have alternative plans to suggest - whether that’s recommending
parents stay aware of what their children are doing online, an opt-in
filter for those who want it, or something like the previous
Government’s NetAlert software. (Although that wasn’t downloaded much at
all - so is there really the demand for an internet filter?)

Online action is great, but it doesn’t have anything close to the effect
that face-to-face communication does. If you really want to make a
difference, get into those politicians’ offices.

Free people the world over must stop expecting governments to solve
their problems. Good luck to you.

Hey Pat,

I didn’t notice your post until your email to SBA today - thanks for the
heads up. One thing I forgot to mention in my post today at
http://www.geoffmcqueen.com/2009/01/07/my-chat-about-nocleanfeed-with-sharon-bird-mp/
was that Sharon (my local member) was wondering aloud to herself whether
a better way to spend the money would be to fund education/training for
parents so they’re better able to supervise their kids online.

With TAFE’s all over the place and computer labs, the concept sounds
like a pretty darn good one. So, that’s another “solution” people can
add to their arsenal.

Hey Pat,

Great comment @Geoff McQueen - an excellent suggestion. Who is your
local memeber and where is she based? I ask because…

…a key to running a good campaign against the filter IS actually going
to be connecting some dots for the politicians behind the scenes. Pat,
the fact that your local member didn’t know about the issue as you is a
GOOD thing. This means that, if members get enough requests for meetings
with their public, THEY will begin knocking on Conroys door asking for
advice, information, briefing and recommendations. Hr Bob McMullin, who
is the Parliamentray Secretary for International Development Assistance,
lauded the work of the Make Poverty History campaign largley because he
was innundated by calls of fellow ministers terrified of numerous
upcoming meets with their public to discuss the issue.

The fact they knew nothing, and that they would be questioned, led them
to seeing Bob, which enabled Bob to go to KRudd and lobby (successfully)
for an increase in the % of GDP contributed to Forgeign Aid by the
Australian Government.

If, as Pat rightfully points out, we can continue to meet local members
and encourage them to simply ask the questions “what else could we do to
meet the honourable goal of reducing the exposure of children to
dangerous things on the internet” we can provide them with topics to go
to Conroy with. This is why meeting with a local member is
powerful…because if they get scared then the go straight to conroy and
note the concerns of ‘their voters’

Hope that helps. Pat, you’re doing a tremendous job of providing this
topic a lightening rod for action. Well done :)
