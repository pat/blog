Another quick Sphinx post - [Riddle](http://riddle.freelancing-gods.com)
is updated to support Sphinx’s latest release (0.9.8r985), and [Thinking
Sphinx](http://ts.freelancing-gods.com) now has that new version of
Riddle as well.

I’ve not tested any of this with the [recently released Ruby
1.9](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/12/25/ruby-1-9-0-released/)
yet, though (but it’s on my list of things to do).

Also, thank-you to [Joost
Hietbrink](http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/6653-joost-hietbrink)
(again) and [Jonathan Conway](http://www.jaikoo.com/) for their patches
to Thinking Sphinx - very much appreciated.
