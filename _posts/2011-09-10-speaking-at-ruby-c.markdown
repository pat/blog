Just a quick note for anyone in or near Eastern Europe - I’ll be heading
over to Kiev for [RubyC](http://rubyc.eu) in November. I’m going to be
speaking there about how to build gems and the best practices when doing
so.

So, if that interests you (or you’d just like to catch up or hear some
of the [other speakers](http://rubyc.eu/program) talk about interesting
Ruby-related topics), then hopefully I’ll see you there!
