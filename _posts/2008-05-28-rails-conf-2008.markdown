I’ve just started my round-the-world conferences-and-holiday adventure,
and the first stop is RailsConf in Portland - so if you’re in town and
see me wandering around looking rather cluelessly, please say hi.

Also, in case you’re on the Twitter bandwagon, you’ll find me with the
creative nickname of [pat](http://twitter.com/pat).

Hey Pat, nice to have met you. Your round-the-world adventure sounds
