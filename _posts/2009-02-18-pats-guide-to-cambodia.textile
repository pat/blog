I've recently returned to Melbourne after spending four months based in Cambodia. I've learnt a stack about the country and culture, and I figure it might come in handy for others travelling through, so I've got a few blog posts lined up with various tidbits of information.

Some will be pretty generic - useful for Cambodia in general - while some parts will be focused on the city of Battambang (aka The Bong), which is where I was living.
