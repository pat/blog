A few random items:

-   There’s a [Rails Camp](http://railscamp08.org) happening in Denmark.
    How awesome is that!?
-   I’ve added an [About Me](http://freelancing-gods.com/about) page to
    this blog - filled with opinions. You have been warned.
-   I’m talking at [NYC
    Ignite](http://radar.oreilly.com/2008/07/ignite-nyc-soldering-guerilla.html) -
    come along and listen to me talk quickly about non-Ruby stuff for
    five minutes, if you’re near that part of the world.
-   [Joss Whedon is awesome](http://drhorrible.com).
-   So is Pixar. You must see Wall-E. Easily the best film I’ve seen
    all year.
