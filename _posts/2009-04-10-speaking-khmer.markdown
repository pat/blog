\*This is the second of [my guides to
Cambodia](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/pats_guide_to_cambodia.*)

While I’m pretty good with programming languages, spoken languages is a
completely different kettle of fish. Still, I spent a long enough time
in Cambodia to pick up some Khmer - not enough to have conversations,
but generally enough to get the gist of what the locals were saying to
me.

Khmer has its own character set - sixteen vowels and thirty-five
consonants - so my attempts to provide speaking guides below aren’t
anything to swear by. There’s a few characters that can be translated as
mixtures of our own, such as bp and dj.

Also, keep in mind that if you speak more than the very basics, then
you’ll get one of two reactions. Either the Khmer will assume you know
the language, and will answer in the same language - which quite likely
won’t be that helpful; or, they’ll do a double-take, and repeat what you
said and laugh. The latter happened to me a lot in Siem Reap in
particular, because Westerners (*Berangs*) that speak Khmer in such a
tourist-heavy location are few and far between.

If you get stuck in the former situation though, I’d recommend saying
“Khmer tik-tik” (small Khmer), and they’ll probably laugh and then
switch back to English, should they know any.

### Greetings and Thank-you

-   Hello: Soos’dai
-   How are you?: Sock-sa’bai? (Literally: Healthy and Happy? This can
    also be used as the response - much like *ça va* in French)
-   Happy: Sa’bai
-   Very Happy: Sa’bai na
-   Good: L’or
-   Very Good: L’or na
-   Thank-you: Oarkun
-   Thank-you very much: Oarkun Djeraan
-   Yes: Baht (when said by males) or Djaa (when said by females)
-   No: A’tay (Again, works very similarly to the French *ne pas*, with
    the word being negated going in between, as shown in the
    next example).
-   No Problem: At-banya-ha, or more correctly At-banya-ha-tay.

*Sock-sa’bai* is used as a general greeting, and more than often will be
the response offered in return. If you want to be a bit of a smart-arse,
you can switch the syllables of *Sock-sa’bai* to *Sai-sa’bock* - which
is something the Khmer do themselves occasionally, but a Westerner
saying it is often seen as a great joke to them.

### Numbers

The Khmer counting system is pretty easy to get your head around - it
generally works by fives, as you can see below. The only thing I find
tricky is each multiple of ten has no connection to the factor (ie: 2
and 20 don’t sound the same).

-   1: Moi (as in Moira)
-   2: Bpee
-   3: Bai
-   4: Buan
-   5: Pram
-   6: Pram-Moi (ie: 5 + 1)
-   7: Pram-Bpee
-   8: Pram-Bai
-   9: Pram-Buan
-   10: Dop
-   11: Dop-Moi (10 + 1)
-   12: Dop-Bpee
-   16: Dop-Pram-Moi (10 + 5 + 1)
-   20: Moi’pai
-   21: Moi’pai-Moi (20 + 1)
-   30: Sam’sup
-   40: Sae’sup
-   50: Ha’sup
-   100: Moi-roy
-   121: Moi-roy-Moi’pai-Moi (100 + 20 + 1)
-   200: Bpee-roy
-   1000: Moi-bpuan

Wikipedia has [a lot more detail on the number
system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khmer_numerals), if you’re feeling
curious.

### People

When talking about people, you’ll generally indicate their age (younger
or older than yourself) and gender.

-   Older: Bong
-   Younger: Ohn
-   Male: Proh
-   Female: Srei

So, if you’re at a restaurant, and you want to get the waiter’s
attention, it’s best to err on the side of seniority, and call him
*Bong-Proh*. An older woman is *Bong-Srei*, although *Bong* will likely
be fine in both cases. The literal translations are older/younger
sister/brother, but it’s not meant as an indication of immediate family
(although they are also used in that manner).

-   Older Sister: Bong-Srei
-   Older Brother: Bong-Proh
-   Younger Sister: Ohn-Srei
-   Younger Brother: Ohn-Proh

Keep in mind this is just the basics - I didn’t really get my head
around the rest.

### Dining and Shopping

This is one area where I’m quite rusty - I never really ordered in true
Khmer restaurants (only places that catered for Westerners). You’ll
notice, though, that each meat shares the same prefix - *Satch*, meaning
flesh. So if you see the live animals (ie: a cow), just call it *Ko*,
instead of *Satch-ko*.

-   Chicken: Satch-muern
-   Beef: Satch-ko
-   Pork: Satch-cheruu
-   Banana: Jake
-   Tasty: Chng’ngyang (this one takes a bit of practicing)
-   Delicious: Chng’ngyang na (literally, very tasty)
-   Cheers: Chul moi (As one)
-   Money: Loy
-   Can I have the bill?: Som kit loy?
-   How much is this?: Tly pon-man?
-   Expensive: Tly na
-   One more: Moi tiet

### Directions

-   Turn right: Bat saddaam
-   Turn left: Bat schweng
-   Straight ahead: Dtrong
-   Here: Tini
-   There: Tinu

### Everything Else

-   Westerner: Berang (in the past, this meant French, as they
    ‘colonised’ the region, but it’s now a catch-all term for any
    Anglo-looking person)
-   Pretty: Sa’at
-   Beautiful: Sa’at na (literally, very pretty)
-   Small: Tik-tik
-   Large: Tom-tom
-   Slow: Yuut-yuut
-   Strong: Klung
-   Miss: Nook (as in, to miss someone)
-   Dog: Ch’kai
-   Cat: Ch’maa
-   Don’t need: A’trega (Useful when dealing with the never-ending calls
    of touts for taxis, tuk-tuks and motos in Phnom Penh and Siem Reap)
-   Have: Mien
-   Already: Howie
-   Have already: Mien Howie

That should give you a decent start - although I’m sure I’ll think of
more words tomorrow. Next up in this series (and hopefully appearing a
bit more quickly than this post) is tackling travel around Cambodia.

Dear God.

I have a problem and I’m grasping for straws… My name is Annika from
Sweden and I’m doing a course in Project Management and todays
assignment is net-working. I’ve recieved a text in an Asian language
(probably in Cambodian), and to pass on this part of the course, I have
to get it translated within 24 hrs… so I’m running short of time -
merely six hrs to go. Could I by any chance e-mail my pdf-file to you to
glance upon, God? It’s one page of text and I just need to know,
roughly, what it’s all about.

Please God, answere my prayers and I’ll be so, so very greatful. Best
regards, Annika

Hi Annika

Freelancing Gods is just the name of this site - my name’s Pat, so I’m
assuming your question is actually directed at me.

I can’t read Khmer/Cambodia, so I’m afraid I can’t help you. There are
people in Cambodia who can translate, but this is definitely not a free
service, and I’m not sure how quickly they can get it done. It’s
definitely not going to happen in your timeframe (which may be over
already?)

I’m sorry I can’t be of more help at the moment.

Hi again, Pat. Yes, the question was directed to you but I really
enjoyed the name of your web site, therefore the “prayer-like” approach,
sorry :-)

By the way, the assignment got solved by helpful members of a Khmer
group on Facebook, which was great! Unfortunately an hour too late,
though, but that doesn’t matter in the long run…

Thank you for your answer and take care! Annika

I was reading something about contributors on ruby community and you as
mastermind about Thinking sphinx.. and I end up on your blog reading
something much more interesting to me about Khmer :) how long did you
stay in Cambodia?

PS: If you get a chance, you should learn to read and write. I did it
prety quickly as it is not that hard to pick up.

Hi Emmanuel - great to find someone appreciated this blog post. I wonder
how many Ruby people find it a little odd ;)

I was in Cambodia for four months, and I’m hoping to visit again -
although probably for not quite so long - within the next 12 months or
so. I might give reading and writing a shot then!

“Meat” is more “seik” than satch.
(Beef sounds like “psycho”!)

Learning to write made a huge difference to my speaking.

Can’t wait to get back to Cambodia. I spent four months there last year
but had to go back to the States due to a family emergency. Too bad I
didn’t learn very much of the language. Now I’m in China and next August
I plan to come back to Cambodia. This time I’ll be staying for a few
years at least if not for the rest of my life. I’m trying to learn the
language now. I’ll be able to read and write Khmer by the time I get
back to PP in August and I’m sure my skills will sky rocket after that.
