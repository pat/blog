I don't want to bore you all with an extensive recap of 2007, so I'll keep this footnote of the last year's highlights relatively brief.

h3. "Nullus Anxietas":http://ausdwcon.org

After a few years planning, we produced the first Australian (and non-UK) Discworld Convention in February - and it was a smashing success. A few hundred attendees, dozens of sessions, a load of fun. We even made a small profit (which is rare for fan conventions) - and we proved the doubters wrong.

h3. Rails and Freelancing

I began the year by switching jobs and finally getting paid to work with Ruby on Rails. Halfway through the year, I started freelancing. I'm really enjoying working from home, on my Mac, using tools and a programming language I enjoy. After far too long wrangling with ASP and ASP.NET, coding is fun again.

h3. RailsCamps

As part of working with Rails, I've become involved in the "local Ruby communities":http://www.rubyonrails.com.au here in Australia. Through this, there's been two awesome "RailsCamps":http://railscamp07.org (and massive props to Ben Askins for leading the way with the first, and helping so generously with the second), and I've met a bunch of smart, friendly folk. Networking has become socialising.

h3. Change

The last of my siblings has finished their secondary schooling. My sister's moving to another state. I'm posting regularly to this blog. Howard's out - and not much longer to put up with Bush. Climate change is being taken seriously by many governments. There will be a proper apology to the indigenous people of Australia.

h3. What's next?

For me, 2008 is looking to be a year of travel - to New Zealand for a holiday in a few weeks, and then to Portland for "RailsConf":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2008/public/content/home, UK and Cambodia to visit friends (and in the case of the former, check out the Edinburgh Fringe Festival), and stops to New York and Istanbul will likely feature in there as well.

Freelancing will continue to be challenging as my first big contract ends and I look for new ones, and there's already plans for more RailsCamps and a second Discworld Convention. I'm looking forward to all of it.

Endless thanks to my family, friends and peers for their support over the past twelve months - you're all brilliant.

Yeah 2007 was an awesome year, full of personal change for a lot of people I know, and full of political change too. Something that's changed from 2007 to 2008 for me is that my skepticism about Rudd has given way to a grudging and wary respect. I'd even say I feel cautiously optimistic about the guy. Wierd.
