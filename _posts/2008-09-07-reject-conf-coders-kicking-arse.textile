One of the highlights from RailsConf EU last week was RejectConf - even if it was a bit smaller than last year (going by what I've heard, anyway).

I reprised my "So You're A Kick-Arse Coder":http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/so_you%27re_a_kick_arse_coder talk for it - since it was a rejected talk from the main event - and "Geoffrey Grosenbach":http://topfunky.com/ managed to get an audio recording, so I've put that together with the slides and onto "Viddler":http://www.viddler.com/explore/Freelancing_god/videos/4/. Keep in mind the following caveats:

* I'm pretty happy with this talk - but I realise I'm not that great a speaker. Imagine what I'd be like on a bad day ;)
* Geoff didn't catch the very start of the talk, which went something along the lines of "Hi, my name's Pat, and I'm Australian [Cheers from Audience] I want to start of with some flattery, because I want to get on your good side."
* Geoff's also the heckler about two-thirds of the way though.
