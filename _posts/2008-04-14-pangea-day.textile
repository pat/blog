Prompted by an email from TED, I watched three videos on YouTube this evening - of residents of one country singing the anthems of another country. It's an awesome idea, and the different approaches really add to it.

* "France for the USA":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T60NaNPiMg
* "Kenya for India":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAWarHi0OgE
* "Japan for Turkey":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBStEQvgcyM

These short clips are inspired from an event that's happening on the 10th of May, "Pangea Day":http://www.pangeaday.org. I'd read mentions of it before (probably in TED emails, again), but I only had a browse of the site tonight, and I'm loving "the idea":http://www.pangeaday.org/aboutPangeaDay.php:

<blockquote cite="http://www.pangeaday.org/aboutPangeaDay.php"><p>"Pangea Day is a global event bringing the world together through film.</p><p>Why? In a world where people are often divided by borders, difference, and conflict, it's easy to lose sight of what we all have in common. Pangea Day seeks to overcome that – to help people see themselves in others – through the power of film."</p></blockquote>

It sounds simple, but I think things like this are really effective. I'm only disappointed that I won't be home in Melbourne that day - as there's screenings at "Federation Square":http://www.federationsquare.com.au/ and "Cinema Nova":http://cinemanova.com.au/. Nothing so public for Sydney that I've found so far...

(Your regular ruby-focused programming will return later in the week.)

*Update*: Just found a fourth video - "Australia for Lebanon":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NRCt9NQqEE!
