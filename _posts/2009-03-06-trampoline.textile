Born out of a discussion about "BarCamps":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BarCamp, "Rails Camps":http://railscamps.com/ and the value they could bring to those not so technically minded, Melbourne will be hosting the first "Trampoline":http://trampolinemelb.com on Saturday, the 28th of March.

This is something "Mel":http://twitter.com/melinachan, "Steve":http://thesquigglyline.com/blog, Bei and I have been discussing for a few months now - bringing one hundred inquisitive people together to discuss interesting and amazing ideas covering various disciplines. In true unconference style, the schedule will be determined on the day by those who are there - you don't need to be an expert in your field to share what you think is awesome.

We've got some fantastic space at DonkeyWheel in the CBD lined up, and already half the tickets are taken (so if this sounds like fun, I recommend "registering":http://trampoline.eventwax.com/trampoline-melbourne/register sooner rather than later). People are already sharing the topics "they want to share and hear about":http://groups.google.com/group/trampoline-melb/web/whos-coming, and that discussion will ramp up as we get closer to the event.
