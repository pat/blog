Just under two weeks ago, we ran the third "Trampoline":http://trampolineday.com - an informal unconference which brings people from a variety of disciplines together to share what they find amazing.

The day is filled with 20 minute sessions on whatever people who are there offer to discuss. We get a fantastic mix of topics: health, technology, education, dance, meditation, music, media, juggling, comedy, entrepreneurship and more. In true unconference style, none of this is planned beforehand - no speaker is given preference, there's no keynotes.

All three thus far have been in Melbourne. We're definitely interested in sharing the love to other cities (but nothing's locked in yet). That said, it's a pretty safe assumption that Melbourne host its fourth sometime towards the end of the year.

From a personal perspective, I find these days amazingly energetic and inspiring (granted, I'm a little biased, being one of the organising team). It's provided me (and many others) an avenue to connect with interesting, passionate people they wouldn't normally meet. It's just one of many things happening in Melbourne that solidifies my belief that it is truly - if you'll excuse the hubris - a *global cultural hub*.

I'm pretty stoked with how well received Trampoline has been thus far, and looking forward to making the next one even better. Would love to see some more new faces there too, so if you're keen, jump on "the list":http://trampolineday.com/subscribers/new or get in touch!
