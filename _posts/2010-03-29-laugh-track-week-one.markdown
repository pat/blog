Last week, I launched a website I’ve been working on in my own time:
[LaughTrack](http://laughtrack.com.au). It follows what people are
saying on Twitter about the [Melbourne International Comedy
Festival](http://www.comedyfestival.com.au), and provides ratings on
whether the crowd thinks a show is good or not.

I’m not going to get too caught up in the site itself right now - that
deserves a separate blog post, and I’ve not found time for that.

However, I just wanted to report on the acts that have had the most buzz
over the course of the opening week:

I chose the top ten, but there’s quite a few that jumped up to 53, so
you get a few extra.

It’s worth noting that those last five gained just three positive
tweets. So, at this point it doesn’t take too many tweets to get someone
jumping up the board. However, the higher the rating is, though, the
slower the rating increases, so let’s look at who got the most positive
tweets as a comparison:

Again, a top ten, with one extra because of the same increase.

It’s interesting that almost all on the first list are comedians still
making their stamp on the comedy scene. The second list has several more
established acts. Only Celia Pacquola made it into both.

Of course, the older tweets were from other festivals - in particular,
the Adelaide Fringe and the Brisbane Comedy Festival, which both
happened in the lead-up to Melbourne’s Comedy Festival. So these numbers
are far from perfect (but then, divining quality from Twitter isn’t a
science anyway).

Hopefully you’ve found this somewhat interesting (well, if you’re a
comedy buff) - expect more reports as the festival progresses. If you’re
in Melbourne, I hope you’re making the most of this fabulous time of
year!
