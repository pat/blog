In case you've not booked your ticket yet, but were considering coming and needed one more reason: I'll be giving "a tutorial on Sphinx":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7770 at "RailsConf":http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/ in Las Vegas next month. To get 15% discount, use the code 'RC09FOS'. (O'Reilly seem to hand out codes everywhere. If you paid full price this time, keep that in mind for next year.)

If you will be there, I'm more than happy to have a chat - about Sphinx or anything else - so let me know if you want to meet up.

For those of you who know Sphinx and Thinking Sphinx already, I'd love to hear about the things you found a bit difficult when learning. What are the topics I should make sure I cover in my tutorial, that are maybe lacking in documentation?
