The Melbourne International Comedy Festival is almost upon us for 2019 - one of the highlights of my year, and the best time to be in Melbourne. And as per usual, I have a few recommendations on performers to see.

Some comedians who I _strongly_ recommend based on recent years:

* [Felicity Ward](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/busting-a-nut) always brings a touch of heart and humanity alongside the hilarity to her shows. I'm very happy to see she's performing again this year after taking a break in 2018.
* [Wil Greenway](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/wil-greenway-either-side-of-everything) is a relatively recent discovery for me - and he's very much a storyteller rather than a comedian. Each time I've caught his shows, I'm moved by the reflections of humanity weaved with delightful words and heart.
* [Danny Bhoy](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/danny-bhoy-age-of-fools) doesn't visit Melbourne as often as he used to, but I'm looking forward to seeing how his charming and honest humour has evolved.
* [Wil Anderson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/wil-informed) probably doesn't need any promotion, but his show last year was him at the very top of his game - smart, funny, and with a perfectly crafted story. Even if this year doesn't quite hit those heights (it's a tough ask), he's still very clever and hilarious.
* [Daniel Kitson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/daniel-kitson) is another long-time festival favourite - I'm expecting more stand-up than storytelling this time around, but either way I know there'll be laughs and beautiful wordplay. A late night show that'll apparently go for two hours - so you'll definitely get your money's worth.

Other regulars who I'm keen to see include [Cassie Workman](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/cassie-workman), [Mark Watson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/mark-watson), [Alanta Colley & Ben McKenzie](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/you-chose-poorly), and [David O'Doherty](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/david-o-doherty). [Lano & Woodley](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows/lano-woodley) are repeating last year's excellent and hilarious Fly, which was deservedly nominated for the Barry Award.

This is just a small handful from [the massive amount of shows available](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2019/shows?filters[sort]=alpha&filters[category]=&filters[date]=&filters[venue]=all&filters[accessible]=) - [do let me know](https://twitter.com/pat) about any of your own highlights and recommendations!
