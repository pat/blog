I was about to write a new post about something technical, but that can wait for another day. Right now, I want to highlight to the world "Inspire9":http://inspire9.org, a coworking space here in Melbourne.

Now, Inspire9 is also "a web development business":http://inspire9.com/, run by the talented and generous "Nathan Sampimon":https://twitter.com/nathan_scott. When the word spread a few years ago that he had an office for himself but others could drop by, I started visiting - "as did others":http://thesquigglyline.com/blog/uncategorized/how-to-start-a-co-working-space-like-inspire9/. Slowly the numbers grew, and instead of being just "Nathan's office", there was a growing sense of community and shared ownership, and it had become a much-loved coworking space.

As part of that growth, we had clearly outgrown our existing space - a measly 77 square metres - and so plans were hatched for something much larger. Halfway through last year, we moved into our new residence at 41 Stewart St, Richmond (right beside Richmond Station), with 370 square metres to work and play in (and that'll eventually double to 720).

Our office is now a bustling hive of activity - there's usually somewhere between 20 and 30 people in each day at any one point. Many of us have dedicated desks (it is something I happily pay for). That said, not everyone who works from Inspire9 are residents - anyone is welcome to "drop by":http://dropin.inspire9.com.au and use a desk, and it's free.

It's occurred to me to write about Inspire9 now because of what's happened in the last 24 hours. Last night, someone stole Kealey's iPhone while she was making sure an event in the office was running smoothly. "Kealey":https://twitter.com/kealey is not only our events manager, but also a key part of the heart and soul of Inspire9 - so we were all pretty upset, and doubly so because it happened in our midst, in our home.

Not content with this situation, this morning "Ned":https://twitter.com/nedwin got a "pledgie":http://pledgie.com/ running to help fund a new iPhone for Kealey. Within two hours we had the funds, and by the end of today Kealey had a shiny new iPhone in her hands. The full story has been covered on the Inspire9 blog, and I particularly love the title, a very appropriate '"Restoring Balance":http://blog.inspire9.org/general/restoring-balance/'.

While Inspire9 is a fantastic place to work, it's the community that makes it stand out. I consider myself very lucky to be a part of it.

So, if you find yourself in Melbourne, please do visit. You're welcome to pull up a chair and get some work done, or perhaps challenge someone to a game of pool. We also now host the Melbourne Ruby and Python meets every month (as well as plenty of other events), and we're a friendly bunch - don't be afraid to say hello!
