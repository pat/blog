**Update: Jesse’s talk is [now
online](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hirsh-california-ideology)
should you want to watch it.**

Before this all fades from my brain in the post-conference haze, I just
wanted to post a few thoughts on the final session of the amazing
[FutureRuby](http://futureruby.com/) conference in Toronto. [Jesse
Hirsh](http://jessehirsh.com/) delivered an impassioned argument against
what he labels the Imperial Californian Idealogy.

As someone who is most definitely left-of-centre, the bulk of this talk
appealed to me. A call to action, highlights of the flaws of the
capitalism, railing against the environmental destruction caused by the
pursuit of wealth - it ticked the boxes.

There were a lot of references to the prominent place in history that
San Francisco holds when it comes to mining, wars and weaponry,
corporations and politics. I won’t go into those, because I’ll probably
get it wrong. I have no bones to pick with that part of the talk,
though.

It wasn’t immediately clear to me that he was attacking (some of) the
ideals put forward by [Stewart
Brand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stewart_Brand), [Kevin
Kelly](http://www.kk.org/) and [Chris
Anderson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Anderson_(writer)) - at
first, I thought they were the alternative movement to the old San
Francisco elite that was initially described. All three names hold some
credibility for me, so that was an interesting twist.

That said - and if we take the points on Anderson’s *Free* as accurate -
then I’m happy to buy into at least some of the criticism, particularly
around the push for acceptance of waste. I agree completely that the
wasteful nature of people has got us into the current ecological mess.
It promotes a very narrow, selfish view, instead of a more holistic
approach. Indeed, holistic solutions was the end point Hirsh was driving
at.

My main issue? The revolutionary, us-vs-them vibe. It felt implied that
we are the elite, the creators, the visionaries. The ones who know best,
the ideal internet citizens. There’s enough division in the world as it
is. Not that I think Jesse is advocating such an approach, but that’s
how the message came across to me. Granted, the *Snowcrash* references
were lost on me, so that didn’t help.

Besides, revolutions are (more often than not) ineffective routes to
change. Evolution is the road I much prefer to walk down.

Anyway, I’m off to the afterparty to discuss all this further with other
attendees. If you weren’t there, then this probably doesn’t make much
sense to you - [watch the
video](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/hirsh-california-ideology),
see if that helps.

Agreed on all your points, though I can forgive a bit of the us-vs-them
as I think it was mostly just to hype us up and reinforce the community
vibe that was so prevalent over the weekend. The calls to action were
all on a personal level as far as I could tell, not things meant as
antagonistic towards “them”. Meaning we can take their power from them
just by opting out of their game. We will talk more soon.

It’s interesting that you wrote a post about it, because the talk
angered me quite a bit. I had to fly out right after the conference, but
I hope there was a discussion about this afterwards.

I felt that it did give me a sense of us vs. them and the impression
that we are better than them. I really disliked the comments about how
everyone on Facebook and Twitter are idiots (although I’m not on
either), and how the “Internet has gone to shit”. If we’re really gonna
go there, the world has gone to shit. The Internet was not made just for
us programmers because we’re special in some way. The evolution of the
Internet to allow the inclusion of the public has helped us more than we
are ever going to admit.

It is also obscene to be part of a community in which everyone seemed to
feel we were the elite. It’s not like we have a lack of arrogant
programmers. Humility is the only way to learn and improve. Maybe we
should be preaching that next time.

Serene: Appreciate your thoughts on the issue, and it’s sparked a bit
more reflection for me.

Completely agree that elitism should be avoided, and it wouldn’t hurt
the Ruby community to have a solid dose of humility. This really needs
be reinforced, because it’s so easy for people to get caught up in the
passion of the talks, drink the kool-aid, and ignore other opinion. I
think it’s fair to say this is the case moreso at FutureRuby than
RailsConf, because of the nature of the event.

Definitely something to keep in mind for the next iteration of
RubyFringe/FutureRuby.

I had a great time and learned from all sessions. But I agree with
Serene, although was not quite angered as much. It is hard for me to
take someone too seriously who primarily uses negative-sell to press a
point.

At at the beginning, Hirsh said Twitter was full of lame, but later it
is a leading basis for many traditional news pieces… I was a bit puzzled
- is he saying the content of Twitter useful or not? Or was he saying
there are just idiots on Twitter, and therefore we should avoid or be
careful using it?

Anyway, a big +1 on humility, maybe a ruby/railsbridge-esque talk next
year. I am more of an ‘us’ person anyway.

So excited to see intelligent discourse on this subject! I even slept
before responding to avoid any XKCD-ish mis-steps.

Part of the reason that we started the conference with failure is that
the web is so full of skin-deep positivity. Yes, it’s true that we learn
from failure, but for me it’s also about allowing ourselves a brief
vacation from the effects of constant false-positive on our brain. I
hope that this makes sense; I’m not talking about encouraging cynicism
but a friendly, calm reality check about the fact that people in our web
hive often tend to be obsessed with painting an unrealistically positive
picture of how things really are.

futureruby was not a trending topic during the weekend. It was not
because people weren’t tweeting furiously, but simply because there are
so many more people on Twitter now. I am not at liberty to say the
number, but it’s a **lot** higher than you think (write down a number
and 15X it, for realz) and with that popularity comes a predictable
decline in signal to noise. It might be pretentious to declare people
talking about banalities “idiots” but Jesse didn’t mean that they were
drooling on themselves so much as that they are “the masses”. People who
think that the last US administration were stand-up guys, or that
climate change is a weak theory. Large groups of people are idiots. I’ve
been an idiot for large blocks of my life.

Anyhow, I hope I can clarify that Jesse was not suggesting that we are
on some higher level than everyone else… if anything, I know that he has
more faith in the working class as a whole than a room full of mostly
white, mostly straight, mostly male geeks.

Instead, his point was similar to what Nathaniel Talbott said on
Saturday: we geeks — the real Morlocks — frequently forget that we have
a massive amount of control, power, and influence in today’s society. We
control the infrastructure of the world! The world relies on us for
communication, transportation, medicine, entertainment, finance, and
even warfare.

Re-read Jesse’s ultimate point: “The struggle for human rights never
ends, the only question is which side are you on?”

FutureRuby was all about breaking out of passivity to use our powers for
good.

I really didn’t come away from that talk with a sense of elitism. One of
the closing points was about getting out there and participating in your
local community - we are special, we are artists with unique skills that
can do a lot of good in this world. You can’t say that about most of
this shit on the internet. Twitter **is** full of fuckwads screwing it
up for everyone else. So is Facebook. But it doesn’t have to be that way
if we have our say.

I’m not on Twitter, and I’m not on Facebook, but Jay Tennier was nice
enough to help me understand what you meant by trending topics, and also
informed me that “Michael Jackson” is still a trending topic. Although I
do kind of agree with Hirsh about the banalities that society finds
interesting, I also know that sometimes I’m not really above it.

There was a girl sitting beside me who is from California, and she
wasn’t really impressed by the comments against the “Californian
Ideology”. It also upset me that it upset her.

I hope that people didn’t leave the talk with a sense of elitism, and
I’m glad that there is intelligent conversation about this instead of a
flame war. We are not perfect and dare I say, neither is Ruby. Yes, we
have some control, and we have some power, but we don’t always do
everything right.

I’m with you, Serene — I don’t want anyone to go home feeling like we
just told them to fuck off! However, if someone from California felt
like they were being personally attacked simply because California is
where Silicon Valley is, that would be unfair to them and Jesse because
that’s simply not what he was saying.

The valley is just highways, strip malls, and office parks. If you ended
up there, you might wonder why you came and what you were expecting to
see. It certainly isn’t beautiful in any aesthetic way! It’s just a
place where stuff happens, and like any place, there’s a hierarchy of
people in charge that use a variety of techniques to keep everyone in
there place. This is just business as usual.

For someone to take umbrage at Jesse’s words, they have to have
something to lose if the majority of people suddenly realize that what
he’s saying is true.

It’s quite likely that the person sitting with you stands to gain a lot
from ditching those same masters.

As creatives and developers and citizens of the Internet, we have a
tremendous amount of power to change these structures. That doesn’t make
us better people, just people that have the power to change things for
the better.

Pete, Anthony, Serene: Thanks for your comments, and sorry it’s taken me
a couple of days to respond. Things are getting crazy for me with
preparations for [Rails Camp](http://railscamps.com).

**Pete and Anthony**: regarding signal to noise on Twitter, I think
we’ve got a bit of a different situation there than in other media,
because of the asynchronous nature of following (instead of friending).
That provides a healthy (well, healthier) level of control over noise. I
imagine it’s only a matter of time until most clients have filters for
incoming tweets, much like you can in mail clients. What needs to be
encouraged is unfollowing, and not feeling obliged to follow back. This
isn’t a new idea, and I’m sure I don’t need to tell you this, your
twitter follower/following numbers indicate you’re well aware of it.

**Anthony**: The idea that we shouldn’t have certain people on Twitter
or Facebook sounds a little elitist to me - or are you suggesting that
we can change the services so people aren’t “screwing it up for everyone
else”, instead of keeping the “fuckwads” off these services?

**Pete**: For what it’s worth, I picked up the attack was not on
California itself, but some of the people and concepts that have come
from it. And I’m generally agreeing with all your other points :)

As for us being people that have the power to change things for the
better, I would love to see discussion on concrete actions that make
that change happen. [It’s something I try to encourage others to
do](http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/reject_conf_coders_kicking_arse).

I should have been clearer - I certainly don’t think those services
should be exclusive in that sense. I have a low tolerance for noise on
Twitter and Facebook and I am very wary of the marketers who just can’t
wait to sink their teeth into them. That’s the “us vs. them” I was
thinking of during Jesse’s talk.

I agree with you about encouraging people to unfollow. I’ve recently
unfriended a ton of people on Facebook and kept my contact to friends
and family only. Same with Twitter to a lesser extent, although I seem
to get a lot of follows from people who obviously don’t care about what
I have to say. I almost wish that I could approve followers on my
account. Thankfully, there is blocking :)

Anyway, thanks for keeping the dialogue going. I’d actually love to hear
what Jesse has to say about the feedback.

I’m only going to leave this one quote, which I love at the moment.

“The future is already here, it is just not evenly distributed yet”
(William Gibson)

Sure, there is an element of ‘us vs them.’ I think there always has been
in all evolutions or revolutions. Why else would we be sparked to change
if we couldn’t see ‘them’ behind us?

The problem becomes, as you point out Pat, one of greater magnitudes
when we believe our world view as the only correct one. Yes, it’s true
that in terms of computer programming and generally getting computers to
do things you want, you guys are kings (well, I admire you!). But, this
doesn’t mean there isn’t already another future here, now, which is
building. This doesn’t mean that there are other leaders, in other
fields (I’m thinking social entrepreneurs in developing economies) who
are not also ushering in an existing future now which we could look at
as stupid, except that it is not at all!

Anyways, great discussion and conversation. I’m quite sure i’ve missed
most (all) of the subtle points and issues surrounding the specific ruby
conversation, but thought I would just drop the quote in anyways. It
helps me daily at the moment. :)

So is it going to go up on BlipTV or someplace where I can download it?
That “InfoQ” setup is horrid.

And pretty ironically so considering the vibe that the conference
appears to be trying to put off.

Jordan: I’m not sure what your concern with InfoQ is, as it’s basically
just Youtube + Slides.

In the case of Jesse’s talk, there are no slides, so you just hit
fullscreen and enjoy.

We have no intention of posting the raw video content, and that has
nothing to do with the “vibe” of the event.

Hugs!

Whatever InfoQ is doing it doesn’t work with gnash, while youtube works
fine. Why not put it on youtube?

The conference appears to be trying to appear as an anti-douchebaggery
meeting. That InfoQ site drips douchebaggery. It seems like a weird
combination.

Like you Pat most of Jesse’s underlying message resonated with me. Yes
we should consider the community impact of our projects. No we shouldn’t
swallow the get-rich-when-google-buys-us approach hook, line, and
sinker. Thinking with our wallets first will not always give us the best
results from a community health perspective.

I didn’t get a strong “us-vs-them” vibe from the talk, although I do
think he’s comments on AOL and twitter users were poorly worded and
overly negative.

My main issue was that his core message was obfuscated by political
buzzword bingo. I too consider myself “left of centre”, however I felt
like I’d been cornered by a neo-marxist on a uni campus. I suppose the
references to revolution, comrades and anarchism were included as a
shock alternative to the status quo, but for me they diluted the
message.

Oh, I’m also not a fan of watching presentations on InfoQ.

I’ve been spoiled by confreaks and now have a strong preference for
downloadable videos I can watch on a device of my choosing at a time of
my choosing. Like my TV or iphone.
