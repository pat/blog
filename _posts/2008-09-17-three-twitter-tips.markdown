Now, I’ve been known to rail against people saying “This is the right
way to use Twitter” - *but* there’s a couple things that I’ve started
doing over the last few months that I think are worth sharing. I’m sure
the expert Twitterers amongst you won’t find this new, and it really is
only a couple of tips - so please suggest others in the comments - but
perhaps some will find it helpful.

So, first up: If you’re following a lot of people (say, more than a
couple of dozen), I recommend you don’t try to read every tweet everyone
says. You’ll go crazy from the information overload. Don’t trawl back
through the pages of tweets you missed while sleeping - just live in the
moment.

Secondly, keep your eye on the [Replies
tab](http://twitter.com/replies). This tracks every tweet addressed to
you by others - whether or not they’re following you or you’re following
them. That in itself is useful, but what makes this extra-special is the
[RSS feed](http://twitter.com/statuses/replies.atom) for that page. This
makes it super-easy for keeping track of messages, with one caveat: you
need a feed reader that supports authentication (such as
[NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/Individuals/NetNewsWire/Default.aspx)).

The last tip I have also ties into RSS - the feeds for results from
Twitter’s [search](http://search.twitter.com). I use this to track
messages about me (so I do get some duplicates with the Replies feed,
but I also see all tweets that mention me but aren’t addressed to me),
as well as a few other keyword searches - in particular, [Rails
Camp](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=rails+camp) and [Thinking
Sphinx](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=Thinking+Sphinx). The latter
not only shows me the occasional tweet of people liking my plugin, but
also gives me the opportunity to contact those with issues or
complaints, see if I can help in some way.

See, told you I didn’t have too much to say.

So, how do you use Twitter? And what tips can you share?

All good points, Pat! The big one I learned hard is evaluate whether you
follow someone (or keep following them) based on the value *of their
tweets* to you.

They can be your best friend, but if all they tweet about highly
technical photographic technique and you have no interest in
photography… That can be okay if you’re following too many folks, but
once you gather a few more, all that extra cognitive load starts to
tell.

The trick is, of course, that maybe your best friend gets upset when
they realise you’re not following them any more. That sucks. It’s
difficult to deal with, but they should have enough self-awareness to
understand. And so should you, because it’ll happen to you too :)

Excellent advice. I have been a Twitter member for a year and a half but
only recently started to use it, mainly because I didn’t know many other
people who used it.

I recently created an app called http://twitterless.com that lets people
keep track of their followers and get notifications when people stop
following them, and so far it has gained some decent traction. I will
definitely be using the search techniques you talked about to keep track
of what people are saying about it as it becomes more popular.

Great post!

I don’t think there are ‘rules’ on how to use twitter, but there are
certainly some common standards around like have an avatar, bio, url..

I reckon you need to be really careful with who you follow, and make
sure you unfollow people who ruin the experience for you before they
ruin it.

Don’t use Qwitter, it’s just depressing.

And wow, you use RSS pretty heavily! I steer clear of RSS with the same
concept you mentioned - don’t worry if you miss stuff that happens in
the stream. Replies are nice to reply to but again if it gets too full
on the world won’t end if you don’t respond to everything.

I think the best way to benefit from twitter is using a program like
twitterfox or twhirl. i use twitterfox, and it downloads my tweets as
they come, and notifies when i have replies and DM’s, the beauty of this
is that i can ignore what happened when i was asleep, but see whats
happening and participate in twitter conversations as they happen

Ikky, that’s a good point - I use Twitterific on my mac, and Twitterfon
on my iPhone, but I forget that newcomers often don’t know about
anything besides the website as an interface into Twitter.
