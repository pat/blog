I've been working away on Thinking Sphinx when I've had the time - and we're nearing what I feel is a solid 1.0 release. I say _we_, because I've had some very generous people supply patches over the last few weeks - namely "Arthur Zapparoli":http://www.arthurgeek.net/, "James Healy":http://yob.id.au/, Chris Heald and "Jae-Jun Hwang":http://www.embian.com/. Switching to "git":http://github.com/freelancing-god/thinking-sphinx/tree/master - and GitHub in particular - has made it very easy to accept patches.

Mind you, all of these changes aren't committed just yet - and even when they are, there'll still be a few more things to cross off the list before we hit the big 1.0 milestone, namely PostgreSQL support and solid spec coverage. Slowly edging closer.

In other news - to help share the Thinking Sphinx knowledge (after some prompting by a few users of the plugin), I've created "a Google Group":http://groups.google.com/group/thinking-sphinx for it - so this will be the ideal place to ask questions about how to implement Sphinx into your app, suggest features, or report bugs.

If you've been pondering how to deploy Thinking Sphinx via Capistrano, I recommend you read "a blog post by Wade Winningham":http://www.updrift.com/article/deploying-a-rails-app-with-thinking-sphinx - or if you're interested in better ways of handling UTF-8 characters outside of the 'normal' set (ie: without accents and so forth), make sure you peruse "James Healy's solution":http://yob.id.au/blog/2008/05/08/thinking_sphinx_and_unicode/.

And one last reminder - if you're in Sydney on Wednesday evening and interested in learning a bit more about Sphinx in general and Thinking Sphinx in particular, come along to "the monthly Ruby meet":http://rubyonrails.com.au/2008/4/29/sydney-meetup-may-2008 at the Crown Hotel in Surry Hills, as those are the topics I'll be presenting on.
