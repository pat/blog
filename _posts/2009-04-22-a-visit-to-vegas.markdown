In case you’ve not booked your ticket yet, but were considering coming
and needed one more reason: I’ll be giving [a tutorial on
Sphinx](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/public/schedule/detail/7770) at
[RailsConf](http://en.oreilly.com/rails2009/) in Las Vegas next month.
To get 15% discount, use the code ‘RC09FOS’. (O’Reilly seem to hand out
codes everywhere. If you paid full price this time, keep that in mind
for next year.)

If you will be there, I’m more than happy to have a chat - about Sphinx
or anything else - so let me know if you want to meet up.

### Crowdsourced Research

For those of you who know Sphinx and Thinking Sphinx already, I’d love
to hear about the things you found a bit difficult when learning. What
are the topics I should make sure I cover in my tutorial, that are maybe
lacking in documentation?
