About 18 months ago, I "posted here":http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/kickstarting_collaboration_and_co_working_over_coffee_in_cambodia about a campaign some friends of mine ran to kick-start some social enterprises in Cambodia through their not-for-profit organisation Kinyei.

These businesses have taken off, and now my friends want to step back and hand them over to their local staff, so they become completely locally owned and run. This push is also in need of some funds though, and so there's "another campaign":http://startsomegood.com/Venture/kinyei/Campaigns/Show/coffee_cycling_and_community. The money raised from this will ensure that the necessary training can be given to the staff, so they're ready to manage the businesses.

There's only a few days before the fundraising deadline, and much like Kickstarter, if the target is not met, none of the funding gets passed through - and Kinyei haven't quite got to that target yet. So, if you can chip in, "please do":http://startsomegood.com/Venture/kinyei/Campaigns/Show/coffee_cycling_and_community!

I've been lucky enough to visit Battambang in Cambodia in the last year, and was able to see the projects in full flight - and it's quite clear that the local staff have gained a massive amount of knowledge, skills and life experience from being involved. Particularly of note is their cafe baristas, who have become so well regarded that they compete at the country barista championships and train baristas at other cafes and hotels in Cambodia.

So if you can send some money their way, I know it'll go to a great cause and make a clear difference. Just head on over to "their campaign page":http://startsomegood.com/Venture/kinyei/Campaigns/Show/coffee_cycling_and_community to donate.
