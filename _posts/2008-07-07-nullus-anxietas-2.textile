A quick post for any Discworld fans that may peruse this blog.

"Nullus Anxietas 2":http://ausdwcon.org, the second *Australian Discworld Convention*, will be happening from the 27th of February to 1st of March 2009, in Melbourne, Australia. The first (in February 2007) was a fantastic success, which is why we're doing it again.

While *Terry Pratchett* sadly can't make it over this time around - he's cutting down on travel because of his Alzheimer's - we've still got some exciting events happening (including the follow-up to "Snowgum Films":http://snowgumfilms.com/' "Run Rincewind Run":http://snowgumfilms.com/runrincewindrun/ - watch it if you haven't already).

Details are a bit thin on the ground at the moment, as we work on fleshing out programme ideas, but if you'd like to come along, "registering":http://ausdwcon.org/memberships/new in the next few days scores you $15 off the already-low early-bird rate of $120 ($100 for concession holders).

If this sounds like your kind of thing, but you're not close to Australia and can't justify the journey, you may want to check out the "UK version":http://dwcon.org - which has been going for over a decade now (although this year's is already sold out), and the "upcoming American edition":http://nadwcon.org/.
