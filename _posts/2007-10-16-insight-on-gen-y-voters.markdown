I caught the last half of SBS’
[Insight](http://news.sbs.com.au/insight/) tonight, which was focused on
Generation-Y voters in the marginal Queensland electorate of Moreton,
currently held by the Liberal Party’s Gary Hardgrave. While some of it
felt pointless and bland, there were a few points from the parts I saw
that grabbed my attention.

### Labor - Still Clueless about the Internet

Graham Perret, the Labor candidate, was present on the show, and I
caught the tail end of him talking about how Labor was using the
Internet. He spoke about how it was another way to get their message out
to the voters - and that’s precisely the wrong way to approach it. While
newspapers, radio and TV are largely broadcast media, the Internet is
far more democratised, and far better suited to engaging people and
getting proper dialog happening.

This is what irritates me about politicians (particularly John Howard)
using Youtube - they treat it very much as just another way to get the
press release out.
[GetUp](http://www.getup.org.au/campaign/EdenMonaro&id=112) is making
use of Youtube in a much more conversational way - there’s no reports
yet on the site about how Sunday’s forum proceeded though.

### People want Politicians to be Humans

There was a researcher on the show - I didn’t catch her name - who had
studied Generation-Y, and (if I am remembering correctly) was talking
about how all voters - not just the younger ones - want politicians to
be funny *and* human. To be honest and approachable. To stop with the
spin. To really connect with people.

Okay, maybe I’m riffing off her ideas into my own, but I think the
feeling was pretty similar. I wish ideas like this would get more
airplay - perhaps the politicians might actually take it on board.

### Beyond the Show

On Insight’s web site, they have a [temporary
forum](http://news.sbs.com.au/insight/chat/) for discussion about the
show. I made a few comments myself, but from a technological
perspective, it’s really not an effective way to encourage discourse.
You also get the trolls - even with the moderators vetting each post -
just like everywhere else, which is a shame.

Of course, it’s tough to get people in a frame of mind where they’re
open to other ideas, instead of just ramming their own down other
people’s throats.

Can honest, approachable politicians exist? The game is about getting
your name out there as much as possible, and it just isn’t possible for
somebody to connect properly with hundreds of thousands of people. Or is
it?

If you’d checked out the Facebook group that SBS made (well done to
them) you’d find that it was much easier to navigate and there were some
very constructive posts. Oh wait, you don’t have an account :)

The game shouldn’t be about getting your name out there as much as
possible - sure it’s part of it, but it shouldn’t be the focus. Ideally,
the good ideas, the discussions, the debates would filter into the news
because they deserve to.

Sorry, I should have prefixed that with an idealism warning.

And there were some constructive posts on the forum hosted on SBS’s site
(indeed, I wouldn’t be surprised if the two are just different views for
the same discussions).

I agree with your thoughts that the internet should be used to start
conversations and engage further with people, rather than just be used
as another PR vehicle.

I think, when done right, the net has the ability to provide politicians
with a tool to portray their humility. Nobody does it right, but they
are learning. Expect to see Kevin11.com be a much more conversational
website :)

Check out this FastCompany article - interesting look at how guys in the
US are doing it

That’s a great article Steve - even if it is 7 years old. Interesting
perspective on how people were pushing politics onto the web before the
bubble burst.

I really like the idea of the online election voting for students - I
actually had someone suggesting something along those lines to me a
couple of weeks ago (although not limiting the vote to students).
