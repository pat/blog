I was watching the always-interesting [Enough
Rope](http://abc.net.au/enoughrope) tonight, I came across a surprising
stat.

One of the segments was focused on a family who had lost their
7-year-old daughter two years ago. She had been signed up as an organ
donor, and her parents were surprised to find out how rare this was - so
they’ve spent a large amount of their time since [raising
awareness](http://www.zaidee.org/) and encouraging people to sign up to
be on the Organ Donor Registry.

The surprising (and disappointing) statistic is that less people signed
up to be donors in 2006 compared to 2005 - and both numbers were less
than 300! In a country of 20 million people!

So… if you’re not a donor, and would like to be, the [Medicare
website](http://www.medicareaustralia.gov.au/public/services/aodr/register.shtml#who)
has the relevant forms. You can even apply online (although they’ll then
send you a form to sign).

If you’re not a donor and don’t want to be, though, I’d be interested in
hearing why. (My original question contained less thought and more
expletives, but I’m open to there being valid reasons.)

I call dibs on your brain.

The reason I am not an organ donor is if my organs are harvested from me
like so much sweetbreads, then they can’t go in my specially prepared,
ritual canopic jars for me to use in the afterlife. If I have to spend
an eternity without a spleen, I’ll be coming after yours.
