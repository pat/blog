If you're a Ruby developer in or near Australia, I highly recommend attending "RailsCamp number 3":http://railscamp08.org, which has just opened for registration. The first two were simply amazing, so I'm just a little annoyed that I can't make it to this one (as I'll be traveling overseas at the time). I've no doubt that this one will be just as fantastic - expect an extended weekend of hacking and talking with a bunch of smart, entertaining and passionate developers, and plenty of drinks and games thrown in for good measure.

You don't need to be a Rails or Ruby genius to attend - just a desire to discuss, learn, teach and (_most_ importantly) have fun.
