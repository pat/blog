This year's Melbourne International Comedy Festival is almost underway... it's definitely going to be a quieter event compared to previous years - understandably, given COVID restrictions and very few international guests. There's still plenty to highlight, though!

My top picks are [Wil Anderson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/wil-anderson)'s Wilegal - previous performed in 2018 and it is genius; the always sharp and brilliant [ZoÃ« Coombs Marr](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/zoe-coombs-marr); a few online shows from UK-based [Mark Watson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/mark-watson-and-friends-wish-you-were-here); and [Randy Feltface](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/randy-feltface), who can be quite, uh, disgusting and disturbing? But hilariously so.

Other shows I'm hoping to see - though in some cases I've not seen these acts before, so your mileage may vary! - include [Adam Hills](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/adam-hills), [Andrew McClelland](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/andrew-mcclelland), [Aurelia St Clair](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/woke-2-0), [Diana Nguyen](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/chasing-keanu-reeves), and [Tripod](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2021/shows/tripod).

As always: if you come across any great shows, [do let me know](https://twitter.com/pat)!
