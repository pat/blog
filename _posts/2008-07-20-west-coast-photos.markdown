As mentioned before on this blog, I’m currently doing some traveling
around the world (so far just the west and east coasts of North America)
- so here’s a few of my favourite photos from the trip thus far.

Oh, and I don’t know much about photography. I don’t use a DSLR.
Suggestions on technique are very much welcome, but a lot of the
terminology still goes over my head.

You need no tips about photography, those shots are stunning. Looks like
a great trip!

Ah, but those are the best shots… they’re definitely in the minority.
Thanks though :)
