This is the written version of a talk I did at
[RailsCamp](http://wiki.railscamp07.org) - it is pretty close to what I
actually said on the day, minus the heckling, discussions and answers to
rhetorical questions.

### So, you’re a kick-arse coder…

<a href="http://xkcd.com/208/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/regular_expressions.png" class="breaker" alt="XKCD Regular Expressions Comic" /></a>

Over this weekend, you’ve created awesome Rails apps - or perhaps you’re
such a code ninja that you’re using [merb](http://merbivore.com/),
[Camping](http://camping.rubyforge.org),
[Sinatra](http://sinatra.rubyforge.org/) or Hack. Well done. You rock.
Honestly.

Perhaps you’ve been doing this for years - maybe you’ve fought off Java
or .NET in a previous life. You’ve made sense of XML, and twisted
Internet Explorer into looking somewhat decent without too many CSS
hacks.

And that’s cool. Really.

But it’s only code, right?

### Alright wise guy. What’s next?

<a href="http://xkcd.com/274/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/with_apologies_to_the_who.png" class="breaker" alt="XKCD My (Geek) Generation Comic" /></a>

So where to from here, then? What’s next? What’s better than code?

To put it simply, although it may sound trite: Make a difference! Give
something back!

Seriously.

And I could finish now - my message was blunt enough. You all got the
point, right?

Ah, but *examples* would be nice. I don’t want to just lecture you with
broad dreams and ideals - let me see if I can give you something to work
with.

Let’s start with the basics. Release code! Let others learn from your
mistakes. Let them save time using your plugins and gems. And this is
also a subtle way of teaching about code.

There are less subtle ways to teach, though.

### What, teaching? Like, in a classroom?

You can’t just type away on your blog and expect everyone to read it and
become enlightened. You need to seek others, instead of waiting for them
to seek out you.

Do people who use `b`, `i` and `font` tags make you sad? Well, go teach
kids how to write semantic HTML. Get them while they’re young.

Contact your old Uni or TAFE and offer to do a guest lecture or two on
unobtrusive javascript. Or some basic pointers on freelancing. Tell them
how important it is to find a good accountant. Encourage them to be part
of user groups and communities like our
[Oceania](http://www.rubyonrails.com.au) group. Give them some idea of
what a reasonable hourly rate is - you know, the kind of things you
needed to know back when you began freelancing.

Do the same at your old high school - drop in on the IT classes, and
give the kids a lesson from someone who actually knows their shit. Run
through the basics of firewalls. Regale them with your networking war
stories (without the geek speak, though).

Be rewarded with glory, recognition, and warm fuzzy feelings.

“Well, that’s nice and all, Pat,” I hear you say. “But surely it’s still
just tech. Even semantic HTML is important, sure, but it’s not
**really** important now, is it?”

“That’s a good point,” is my reply.

### So let’s think a little bigger

<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/scttw/1453196480/"><img src="https://farm2.static.flickr.com/1049/1453196480_eb6f1a37a5.jpg" class="breaker" alt="Mark Pesce at WDS07 with slide saying 'People are the network'" /></a>

The world can always use some help. But it’s so big, and you’re so
small, yeah?

Bullshit. Don’t give me any of those cop-out excuses. To paraphrase Mark
Pesce: “We have been blessed with the biggest and best networking gear
of all the hominids, and we all share the same capability.”

Did you know that all of Delicious Library’s Amazon referral income goes
straight to charity?

Simple, yet effective. I think they’d be cool with you imitating that.

Perhaps you could donate that old hardware you’re not using to a school.
Or, you could push 1% of your income to the NGO of your choice. It ain’t
much, and it ain’t hard.

If you’re looking for a something a little different: Dean Kamen, who
created the Segway, is providing electricity for villages in Bangladesh
with boxes running off cow dung, and pure water for communities in
Honduras. I’m sure he’d love some support.

It can be nice to get a feel for how you’re helping, though - random
donations of money can seem like lip service. One suggestion of an
alternative: Oxfam is an NGO that you can ‘buy’ specific items (cows,
wells, mosquito nets and so on) for communities in third world
countries.

So, take your slick Web 2.0 app, and build these donations into it.
Perhaps as a small part of the account fees. And give your users the
ability to donate more through your app if they wish. They’ll feel warm
and fuzzy, and **you** will feel warm and fuzzy. And it’s all thanks to
Rails! Or, well, something like that.

### But wait! There’s more!

If you’ve got a bit of time up your sleeve (or are willing to make the
time), you could donate a few months to organisations like [Engineers
Without Borders](http://www.ewb.org.au/main/), or [Australian Youth
Ambassadors for Development](http://www.ayad.com.au/) if you’re under
31. Sure, it may mean you have to put up with Windows, or poke around
with PHP - but it’ll be while helping out people in countries like East
Timor, or Nepal, or rural Australia.

### Let’s blow this taco stand!

Now, what I’ve just gone through - it isn’t the *answer*. There is no
silver bullet, no one approach that will always work. But they’re just a
starting point, a few suggestions - and if we put our heads together,
I’m sure we can come up with some better ones.

Gandhi said something like “be the change you want to see in the world”
- and yes, it sounds clich&eacute;d, but it’s fucking true.

Don’t sit on your arse waiting for things to be better, or people to be
smarter, or code to be DRYer.

### Get out there!

I wish I was better at doing this. I agree everyone should give back to
the community and it doesn’t take a massive sacrifice to do. There’s
really interesting academic stuff along these lines on social capital
which is quite intresting. There’s a book called Bowling Alone that
talks about how Americans have stopped giving back to their communities
and what this means. The title refers to how everyone used to go bowling
together in the 50’s and now they don’t.

Nice post Pat! Sounds like it might have been even better “in real life”
:)  
One thing developers who want to “be the change they want to see” could
check out is the Footprints Network:  
http://www.footprints.org.au/  
a network of ecommerce busineses that uses an API to add on
microdonations to online transactions. They’re particularly keen to get
businesses with a large number of transactions on board, so if you’re
involved in a project like this, think about advocating them.

Your disclaimer at the start merely indicates that this is the version
without beer…

Regardless, it’s a fantastic post, as it was a fantastic presentation.
You, sir, are an inspiration!

Jayne: Bowling Alone got mentioned quite a bit in the (single) sociology
subject I did at uni - I’ve not read it though, but I should.

Maxine: That’s a very cool link - will have to keep them in mind -
perhaps even for the next RailsCamp!

Chris: seems *everyone* loves the Interesting Times XKCD comic :)

Lachlan: My ego is getting beyond healthy thanks to your comments - that
said, I’m pretty stoked that you and others enjoyed it.

Well done Pat, I think your post / presentation is fantastic. I’m sure
you understand how I feel about getting back to the community, teaching
people and giving *something* back, its a fucking tough world out there.

Working the **grind** really makes people forget about the kid drinking
out of the dirty cup or even the student who is *only half* interested
in what they’re planning to do for the rest of their lives. Getting out
there and talking to people is probably worth more weight than any
project you’ll ever work. Mark Pesce got a lot of people thinking about
**the network** at Web directions this year (myself included) and I’m
glad you stoked the fire.

Hey Pat,

Loved it :) Can I suggest any of your hombre’s keen enough to put some
money where their mouth is to check out the following…

1) World Visions Stir Child Rescue (www.stit.org.au) (disclaimer, I work
there!)

2) Human Powered Cycles - I met this guy JUST tonight. Human Powered
Cycles builds and rejuvinates pre-loved bikes and then provides them for
free to asylum seekers in Melbourne. They have fixed up about 200 bikes
in the last year, which now provide crucial transport to the people that
need them most in our community. www.humanpowered.com.au

3) Ripple and iRipple (the facebook ap) - http://www.ripple.org/ Built
by some guys in Melbourne…what can YOU guys do?
