The Melbourne International Comedy Festival kicks off for another year next week - I'm slowly making progress on booking all the shows I want to catch.

If you're keen to do the same, here are my recommendations for this year based on previous excellent performances:

* [Adam Kay](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/adam-kay)
* [Ali McGregor](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/ali-mcgregor)
* [Celia Pacquola](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/i-m-as-surprised-as-you-are)
* [Ed Byrne](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/tragedy-plus-time)
* [Felicity Ward](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/i-m-exhausting)
* [Fern Brady](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/fern-brady)
* [Geraldine Hickey](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/dont-tease-me-about-my-gloves)
* [Hannah Gadsby](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/hannah-gadsby)
* [Laura Davis](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/albatross)
* [Nina Conti](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/nina-conti)
* [Sarah Keyworth](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/sarah-keyworth)
* [Wil Anderson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/wilegitimate)
* [ZoÃ« Coombs Marr](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2024/shows/every-single-thing-in-my-whole-entire-life)

Also, for fans of **Daniel Kitson**: he'll be here in June for [a show during the Rising Festival](https://2024.rising.melbourne/program/collaborator-a-work-in-progress). I wouldn't class it as storytelling or comedy - it's really just a great bit of fun.

As always: if you come across any great shows, [do let me know](http://hachyderm.io/@pat)!
