Following in the steps of the Australian Rails Camps, it’s now time to
announce [the first UK edition](http://railscamp08.org). Running from
Friday the 15th to Monday the 18th of August, it will be an extended
weekend of hacking, talking, eating, drinking and games, with a bunch of
smart and passionate Ruby developers.

Even though the name is “Rails Camp”, previous camps have included talks
on topics from Merb to Rack to Extreme Programming - all topics somewhat
related to Ruby are welcome.

If you’d like to come along, I’d recommend
[registering](http://railscampuk.eventwax.com/rails-camp-uk/register)
soon, as there’s a very limited number of places.

wow nice one Pat!

Railscamp in AU has been awesome. I’m sure the UK one is going to rock
too!
