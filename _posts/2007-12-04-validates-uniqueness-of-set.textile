Rails code snippet for the day: "validates_uniqueness_of_set":http://pastie.caboo.se/124537. Useful for making sure each specific combination of the specified attributes is unique. Example from the pastie:

<pre><code>validates_uniqueness_of_set :first_name, :last_name</code></pre>

Just like the options it accepts, the code is very similar to @validates_uniqueness_of@ - and the few tests I've thrown at it are handled without any problems.
