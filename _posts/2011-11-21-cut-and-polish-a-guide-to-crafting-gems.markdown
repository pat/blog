As I mentioned here earlier in the year, a few weeks ago I had the
pleasure of visiting Ukraine and speaking at the RubyC conference in
Kyiv. My talk was a run through of how to build gems, some of the tools
that can help, and a few best practices.

The [video](http://vimeo.com/31903681) of my session is now online, if
you’re interested:

There’s also the
[slides](http://speakerdeck.com/u/pat/p/cut-polish-a-guide-to-crafting-gems)
with notes, if you prefer that.

One of the questions asked towards the end was about publishing private
gems, which I’d not dealt with before. However,
[Darcy](http://twitter.com/sutto) was quick to tweet that
[Gemfury](http://www.gemfury.com/) looks like a promising solution for
those scenarios.

Please let me know if you think I’ve missed any critical elements of
building and publishing gems - or if you have any further questions.

And many thanks to the RubyC team for putting together the conference
and inviting me to speak - I had a great time!
