Just a quick note for anyone in or near Eastern Europe - I'll be heading over to Kiev for "RubyC":http://rubyc.eu in November. I'm going to be speaking there about how to build gems and the best practices when doing so.

So, if that interests you (or you'd just like to catch up or hear some of the "other speakers":http://rubyc.eu/program talk about interesting Ruby-related topics), then hopefully I'll see you there!
