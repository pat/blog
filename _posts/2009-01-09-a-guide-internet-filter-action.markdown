1.  Meet with your local ALP MP or Senator.
2.  Have a conversation with them about the internet filter, ideally
    focusing on **The Message** (below).
3.  Add the meeting details in a comment - the post will be updated
    accordingly (please comment if you’ve already met with a politician
    about this issue).
4.  Spread the word, and encourage others to do the same.

### The Goal

To meet with as many ALP MPs and Senators, and share the message below.
If you don’t have an ALP representative, then visit a Senator for your
State instead. A face-to-face meeting is highly recommended, as it’s far
more effective than an email or letter, and you’re more likely to have a
sensible discussion, rather than getting a form letter response. If
pressed for time, a phone call may suffice, but do everything you can to
speak to the politician in question, not one of their staff members.

Even if your member is already listed below as having had someone else
meet with them, another meeting with another concerned citizen will help
solidify the message that there are serious problems with the
Government’s proposed legislation.

I recommend using the message below - obviously some peoples’ opinions
will differ, and I sympathise (and agree) with the concerns of
censorship and grey lines of what the filter will and will not block.
However, we need to find some common ground and try to direct their
attention to what we feel is a better approach.

When you have a meeting organised, please add the details in a comment
below, so we all have some idea of which politicians have been met with,
and which still need a visit.

Don’t forget:

return to Parliament in February, so try to organise a meeting before
then!

### The Message

The goal of the Government’s Internet Filter is laudable. We have no
argument with wanting to stop child pornography, and make sure children
aren’t exposed to the darker corners of the internet. The problem is
with the approach: an opt-out internet filter will not work.

-   There are plenty of legal tools that route around filtering: those
    who want to seek out such material will be able to.
-   The filter trials have been focused on HTTP traffic, with no
    attention given to peer-to-peer file sharing or instant messaging.
-   Filtering BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer traffic is not
    feasible - an analogy is monitoring every single phone call
    in Australia.
-   It gives the impression the internet will now be safe for children,
    ignoring situations where children are groomed by pedophiles via
    chat rooms and social networks, and may potentially meet face to
    face with these people.
-   It will slow the internet down to some extent.

That doesn’t mean there are no worthwhile solutions that should be
investigated, such as the following:

-   Opt-in filter for those who desire it - whether offered by ISPs or
    as a downloadable tool.
-   Education for parents - via TAFE courses and similar.
-   Compulsory education for children in schools on what to be aware of
    when using the internet.
-   Increased funding for the AFP.

The Government’s current approach is a waste of money - particularly
worrying in these financially uncertain times. We encourage the
Government to change their tact for making the internet safer for
Australians to use, and hope they employ some of the more effective
ideas as suggested above.

Thanks for posting this Pat - it’s what we need to do for a more
constructive dialogue with the Government.

Hopefully when I speak to one of the NSW senators, I can pick their mind
on what they think we need to do to allow Labor out of this tight
position and in a workable solutions for all parties.

I’m going to try to meet up with Senator Faulkner - might be difficult,
but that’s my goal :)

Hi all,

I’ll organise a meeting with Michael Danby, my local member, within the
next couple of weeks. Let me know if you’re interested in coming along.

Steve
