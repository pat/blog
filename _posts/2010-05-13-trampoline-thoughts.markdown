Just under two weeks ago, we ran the third
[Trampoline](http://trampolineday.com) - an informal unconference which
brings people from a variety of disciplines together to share what they
find amazing.

The day is filled with 20 minute sessions on whatever people who are
there offer to discuss. We get a fantastic mix of topics: health,
technology, education, dance, meditation, music, media, juggling,
comedy, entrepreneurship and more. In true unconference style, none of
this is planned beforehand - no speaker is given preference, there’s no
keynotes.

All three thus far have been in Melbourne. We’re definitely interested
in sharing the love to other cities (but nothing’s locked in yet). That
said, it’s a pretty safe assumption that Melbourne host its fourth
sometime towards the end of the year.

From a personal perspective, I find these days amazingly energetic and
inspiring (granted, I’m a little biased, being one of the organising
team). It’s provided me (and many others) an avenue to connect with
interesting, passionate people they wouldn’t normally meet. It’s just
one of many things happening in Melbourne that solidifies my belief that
it is truly - if you’ll excuse the hubris - a **global cultural hub**.

[growing set of

I’m pretty stoked with how well received Trampoline has been thus far,
and looking forward to making the next one even better. Would love to
see some more new faces there too, so if you’re keen, jump on [the
