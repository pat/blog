A few notes and links on the Government finally apologising to the indigenous people of Australia, prompted by conversations with "Ross":http://www.rosshill.com.au/ via twitter and IM:

* 'Sorry' isn't the be all and end all - but it's a good start.
* Howard's intervention to 'save the children' was a load of bullshit bound for failure - top-down approach, handed down from on high, by white people who don't have a clue.
* I don't have any solutions on how to make things better. But as far as I'm concerned anyone suggesting solutions who doesn't work with indigenous communities should seriously consider shutting their mouth.
* There isn't going to be an easy, clear, simple solution.
* But there are people out there putting forward intelligent ideas. Go read "Chris Graham's article in Crikey":http://www.crikey.com.au/Election-2007/20071108-Ministerial-briefing-note-2-To-the-next-Indigenous-Affairs-minister.html
* While you're at it, peruse these articles by "Kylie Lee":http://www.crikey.com.au/Politics/2007220-Why-one-size-fits-all-doesnt-work-in-Indigenous-communities.html and "Claire Smith":http://www.theage.com.au/news/opinion/the-aboriginal-intervention-policy-is-failing/2007/09/17/1189881428729.html?page=fullpage.
* Also topical and definitely worth reading - "Martin Flanagan on Archie Roach":http://blogs.theage.com.au/flanagan/archives/2008/02/saying_sorry.html

I'm looking forward to tomorrow morning.
