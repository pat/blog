One of the things that’s really stood out in my time here in Cambodia is
that the ex-pat community consumes alcohol and cigarettes much more than
back at home in Australia. Leaving alone any judgement over the right
and wrong of this, I just wanted to share some of the thoughts a
discussion with [Mel](http://twitter.com/melinachan) about this led to.

While the ex-pat community here comes from a variety of nations and
backgrounds, and this isn’t a reflection of all of them, it’s widely
accepted that volunteer workers in developing countries often drink (and
use other substances) more often than at home, wherever home may be.

From my own experience with the circles I mix in regularly, I’m in the
minority as a non-smoker, and I’ve not met anyone else here who doesn’t
drink - excluding locals, of course (although plenty of Khmer do enjoy
their beer).

It’s been suggested to me that this is a coping mechanism - life here is
definitely more challenging, especially if you’re not just passing
through as a tourist. You’re in the middle of a different culture,
facing different food, people, language and locations. Alcohol and
smoking can be seen as something familiar - grounding elements in the
face of all the other change. Mel suggested it’s much the same with
backpackers in hostels. Indeed, religion can fill the same role for
other people. For me as I’ve been travelling over the last year, Ruby
was my familiarity to some extent - I was able to meet new people and
feel a bit more comfortable in new countries and facing new experiences,
using common skills and knowledge as a stepping stone.

The smoking in particular is a bit jarring though - it’s pretty common
for people to light up in bars and restaurants (things you can’t do in
Melbourne anymore), and so I’ve been questioning why it becomes more
acceptable here.

Mel’s answer - which makes sense to me - is that there’s an absence of
social norms here. You don’t have your home culture around you, and you
don’t completely assimilate into Khmer culture (especially in the case
of females, as that would mean getting married if you’re not already,
and not going out after dark - well, in the less liberal parts of
society here). In this absence, the few familiar things can become more
common, fill in the gaps in your time.

Maybe it’s possible to draw some parallels to western society - do those
who engage in binge-drinking not have other coping mechanisms to deal
with stress? Is it related to stress at all? Or is this too long a bow
to draw?

Have you seen http://www.eman8.net/blog/?p=43 ?

It might also be worth considering why it is LESS acceptable here in
Melbourne, if we are meant to be such a multi-cultural country?

When I lived in Bangalore, India I struggled to cope. If I didn’t have a
wife and was in India alone I would have gone out drinking a lot more.
The state government containing Bangalore unfortunately made it harder
for expats to “cope” by shutting down all clubs/nightclubs at 11pm each
night. When you finish work at 7pm and can’t get into the city before
9pm due to traffic it is awful to then have to leave and go home 2 hours
later.

To me that seems like a cope out. Obviously I haven’t lived in Cambodia
but I’ve done a lot of traveling and I have lived in the UK for 12mths.
But I think just saying that it’s a coping mechanism seems like an
excuse for behaving badly. Surely if you’re living a community like that
you’re suppose to be setting an example. How can you expect to have a
positive impact on if you’re doing/advocating some of the worst public
health issues that we’re trying to deal with.

I don’t think it’s a coping mechanism; I think the people who drink and
smoke and take drugs to excess, especially in a culture alien to their
own, really aren’t coping at all. I think it’s a way to avoid
confronting the reality of your situation - of having to absorb the
differences and work through them, of realising what all these new
experiences and this unfamiliar way of life means for you as a person
and how they illuminate your own way of life (positively and
negatively). I think it’s also a way of sidestepping the work it takes
to become grounded (*really* grounded) away from the people and the
things have previously defined you as a person.

I think the people that binge (on whatever) in their own culture are
often dealing with similar issues, but that the existential angst comes
from a frustration with the routine of their lives rather than
displacement. Alcohol and drugs change the shape of the world, making it
easier to add a dimension that isn’t there or take one away when it’s
unpleasant. Neither of these things are actually happening; the added
dimension is imagined and the removed one is simply ignored, but it’s
the apparent freedom brought about by the illusion that is important.

I think people are terrified that it’s actually their responsibility for
creating meaning in their own lives. Being in an unfamiliar culture
makes this much, much harder to avoid.

Wow, great article topic, and the comments are spot on too. I agree that
“self-medication” doesn’t really help you cope better, but it is one way
that people **try** to exert control over their own lives (even if the
attempt is misguided).

I love Stef’s point about travel forcing people to face up to their own
lack of control in their lives.

I thought I’d also add to the debate and mention that addictive
personalities often go hand-in-hand with the minor manic states - and
manic people are more likely to uproot themselves in search of new
stimuli. Obviously this won’t apply to all expats, but might add to the
melting pot of reasons.
