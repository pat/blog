As I mentioned here earlier in the year, a few weeks ago I had the pleasure of visiting Ukraine and speaking at the RubyC conference in Kyiv. My talk was a run through of how to build gems, some of the tools that can help, and a few best practices.

The "video":http://vimeo.com/31903681 of my session is now online, if you're interested:

There's also the "slides":http://speakerdeck.com/u/pat/p/cut-polish-a-guide-to-crafting-gems with notes, if you prefer that.

One of the questions asked towards the end was about publishing private gems, which I'd not dealt with before. However, "Darcy":http://twitter.com/sutto was quick to tweet that "Gemfury":http://www.gemfury.com/ looks like a promising solution for those scenarios.

Please let me know if you think I've missed any critical elements of building and publishing gems - or if you have any further questions.

And many thanks to the RubyC team for putting together the conference and inviting me to speak - I had a great time!
