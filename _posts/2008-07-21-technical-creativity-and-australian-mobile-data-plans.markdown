I’m slowly making my way through Richard Florida’s [*The Rise of the
Creative Class*](http://creativeclass.com/) (yes, I should have read it
a couple of years ago, I know), and came across a nice quote -
paraphrasing the thoughts of [Joel
Mokyr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joel_Mokyr), that I thought was
rather apt when considering the stupidity and greed of the mobile phone
carriers in Australia (in general, and in regard to Apple’s iPhone):

<blockquote>
“Technical creativity has tended to rise and then fade dramatically at
various times in various cultures, when social and economic institutions
turn rigid and act against it.”</blockquote>

You could argue Telstra, Optus and Vodafone aren’t doing anything
*against* technical creativity, sure - but they’re certainly not doing
anything [*for* it
either](http://www.smh.com.au/news/iphone-insider/iphone-charges-watchdog-investigates/2008/07/21/1216492331116.html?page=fullpage).

If you want a much better, more detailed write-up, go read [what John
Allsop](http://www.webdirections.org/blog/iphone-in-australia-now-for-the-bad-news/)
[has to
say](http://www.webdirections.org/blog/australian-consumer-watchdog-and-data-pricing-plans/).

Hey Pat,

Good work, the book is a good one. The whole issue of locking
technologies away to certain groups does create a climate where the most
creative cannot do their best work (which is in all of our interests).

But how does this compete with the lowest-common-denominator which those
large companies play in. Assumedly, the most creative wouldn’t sign up
for a locked iPhone because they would see no value in such a contricted
device.

I think the iPhone is for the the general punters, who will be amazed at
having net access for the first time in their pocket, at what is,
honestly, pretty affordable rates.

Steve: the plans may be affordable, but the data limits included are
pretty small. There are no limits in the US and UK.

Also, the charges when you go over are horrendous - as people will
discover, because lets face it, when you start using your iPhone and
realise how easy it is to browse the net, you’re going to use it a lot.
And that will put you over the limits. And you’ll be paying Telstra,
Optus or Vodafone a *lot* of money. With Optus, you’re looking at $22
per extra megabyte.

Hey Pat,

I’ve been using a data plan with 3 for the past year and a bit, so feel
I can respond a little to this one. Yes, you do use a bit of data. And
yes, I only use a Palm Treo…so using the net is not that easy. The
iPhone should dominate in this field, which will raise the amount of
data being used. But, again, remember the kind of people using the
iPhone, given my earlier post. They probably won’t use the net on their
phone just to surf…and may use it checking email or possibly a news
site. But when it comes down to it, their long-duration surf times will
still largely be done on a computer.

You are right on the extra charges though. The thing that catches you
unaware is the ‘Roaming’ component. Using too much data is not the most
likely occurrence (in my mind) but using data at the wrong time. I had
my email set to download every 15 minutes. I went out of the coverage
zone, and my phone started roaming. My bill that month was a whopping
$60 extra…huge when my norm is $100. Beware Freelancing-God
readers![]()!

In the end mate, I agree with you. We can’t ever graduate our uses of
tech if we don’t have the capacity to in the first place. But I think
the iPhone actually creates the option for people to experiment with the
idea of mobile data access at a relatively low cost for the first time.

The telco’s will offer unlimited download when the market demands it.
(Famous last words?)

Hi Pat,

You might be interested in reading *why* the telcos haven’t done
anything for it….I used to work for Hutchison, and have friends in
Telstra.

We were in the network and security spaces. An interesting place to be
fighting battles for open access….

Anyhow, have a read of my view of how this mess developed…

Hi Wade

Thanks for the link to your post - good reading, albeit unsurprising and
disappointing. I spent a year subcontracted out to Telstra, and they
haven’t really *got* it, so can’t expect non-ISP telcos to.
