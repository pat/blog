A quick post for any Discworld fans that may peruse this blog.

[Nullus Anxietas 2](http://ausdwcon.org), the second **Australian
Discworld Convention**, will be happening from the 27th of February to
1st of March 2009, in Melbourne, Australia. The first (in February 2007)
was a fantastic success, which is why we’re doing it again.

While **Terry Pratchett** sadly can’t make it over this time around -
he’s cutting down on travel because of his Alzheimer’s - we’ve still got
some exciting events happening (including the follow-up to [Snowgum
Films](http://snowgumfilms.com/') [Run Rincewind
Run](http://snowgumfilms.com/runrincewindrun/) - watch it if you haven’t
already).

Details are a bit thin on the ground at the moment, as we work on
fleshing out programme ideas, but if you’d like to come along,
[registering](http://ausdwcon.org/memberships/new) in the next few days
scores you $15 off the already-low early-bird rate of $120 ($100 for
concession holders).

If this sounds like your kind of thing, but you’re not close to
Australia and can’t justify the journey, you may want to check out the
[UK version](http://dwcon.org) - which has been going for over a decade
now (although this year’s is already sold out), and the [upcoming
American edition](http://nadwcon.org/).
