Yes, I know it's been quiet here - there's several decent blog posts on the way though. I just wanted to post a quick reminder for any Discworld fans in or near Australia that "Nullus Anxietas 2":http://ausdwcon.org is happening at the end of February, and will be awesome fun. There's also a discount of $15 off attendee prices (a "Hogswatch":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hogswatch#Hogswatchnight special) if you get in before the end of the year (going by AEDT/Melbourne time, of course).

The above little clip was done by the fantastically talented "Snowgum Films":http://snowgumfilms.com/ (also responsible for "Run Rincewind Run":http://vimeo.com/1331679).
