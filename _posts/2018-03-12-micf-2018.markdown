Much to my delight, it's almost time for another [Comedy Festival](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018)!

My particular highlights for this year's upcoming festival include many familiar names from previous years:

* [David Oâ€™Doherty](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/david-o-doherty) with his keyboard and tunes is consistently very funny. If you've seen him before then you know exactly what to expect (and I'm very fine with ongoing style).
* [Laura Davis](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/ghost-machine) is bringing back one of her brilliant shows from a few years ago, Ghost Machine. An excellent mix of thoughtful, awkward, heartwarming, funny, and odd - my favourite show of the 2015 festival when it won the award for best independent production, and I'm very tempted to see it again.
* [Mark Watson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/mark-watson), who I've seen many times. Often heart-filled, and is _always_ charming and funny.
* [Sammy J](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/hero-complex) is doing a once-off performance of last year's Barry-nominated and superb Hero Complex. Highly recommended, and will almost certainly (and deservedly) sell out.
* [Tim Key](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/tim-key) is consistently, bemusingly odd (and I mean that in the best way, though granted, he's not everyone's taste). A touch of poetry, some laughs, and always something unexpected.
* [Watson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/watson-unfinished-business) are always hilarious and high-energy, and fill their shows with such infectious fun.

I'm also looking forward to hopefully catching [Celia Pacquola](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/celia-pacquola-all-talk), [Lano & Woodley](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/lano-woodley), [Wil Anderson](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/wil-anderson-wilegal), and [Randy](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2018/shows/anti-crisis).

Do let me know (via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pat) or email) if you see any excellent shows!
