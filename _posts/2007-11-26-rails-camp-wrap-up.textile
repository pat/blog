"RailsCamp 2.0":http://railscamp07.org finished earlier today - and I think it's safe to declare it a fantastic success (even given my bias).

Massive thanks to Ben and Karen for their hard work getting everyone fed and co-ordinating people in the kitchen (and the RailsCamp bus from Melbourne to Sunnystones). Thanks too to everyone who helped at various points - both in the organising and over the weekend.

Finally, thank you to everyone who came along - these camps are so much fun because of the calibre of people who attend, and their willingness to share ideas, code and laughs.

Will be posting a version of my talk at some point soon... once I've recovered from the weekend.

It was an incredible weekend, huh?

Thank you for all your efforts, Pat. Without you, it wouldn't have happened. And without your presentation, we wouldn't have finished on such a publically deep communal note (not discounting all the crazy deep conversations at 4am, of course)

Thanks for making such awesomeness happen!
