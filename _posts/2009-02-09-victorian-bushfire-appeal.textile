I've been stewing on a few blog posts about Cambodia, but this is a higher priority.

In case you'd missed the news, the state of Victoria (in Australia) has been suffering from some "devastating fires":http://www.theage.com.au/photogallery/2009/02/09/1234027920316.html over the weekend. Over a hundred people have died, and that number's certain to rise as the fires are put out and areas can be accessed by emergency crews. Towns, such as Marysville, have been razed.

If you'd like to donate, "the Red Cross' website":https://www.redcross.org.au/Donations/onlineDonations.asp seems to be the best place, from what I've read.

To get a good idea of how bad things are, it's worth browsing "the latest Boston Big Picture post":http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2009/02/bushfires_in_victoria_australi.html, which features photos of the fires and destruction.
