In case the few readers of this blog are not aware, there's a "RailsCamp":http://wiki.railscamp07.org/ happening just outside of Melbourne, from the 23rd-26th November (not far away at all). It will be a weekend of hacking, chatting, food & drink, and very likely some gaming (along the lines of GuitarHero and WiiSports), taking a similar approach to "barcamps":http://barcamp.org/. The first one, back in June near Sydney, was a fantastic success, and judging by the current list of attendees, I'm expecting it to be much the same.

We're edging closer and closer to being sold out, so if you're considering coming along, I recommend "signing up":http://railscamp07.eventwax.com/rails-camp-07-v20-melbourne/register as soon as possible. Day passes for the Saturday and Sunday are also available.
