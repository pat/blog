Another year, and another [Comedy Festival](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017) approaches!

As it turns out, all of my recommendations for this year (based on previous form) are covered in previous posts, so that makes for a nice concise post this time around:

* Daniel Kitson ([previously…](http://freelancing-gods.com/2012/02/18/the-ballad-of-roger-and-grace.html)) with three different shows: [Stories for a Starlit Sky](https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2017/comedy-cabaret/daniel-kitson-and-gavin-osborn) with Gavin Osborn, the filmed performance of [It's Always Right Now Until It's Later](https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2017/comedy-cabaret/daniel-kitson-on-film), and an in-progress standup show [Not Yet But Soon](https://www.artscentremelbourne.com.au/whats-on/2017/comedy-cabaret/daniel-kitson-not-yet-but-soon). I've seen the first two in my travels and they are storytelling filled with heart and soul. The third is likely to be rough but funny.
* David O’Doherty ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Big Time](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/david-o-doherty).
* Hannah Gadsby ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Nanette](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/hannah-gadsby-nanette).
* Justin Hamilton ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Bunta Boy](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/justin-hamilton-bunta-boy).
* Laura Davis ([previously…](/2016/02/27/micf-2016.html#laura-davis)) with [Cake in the Rain](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/laura-davis).
* Cassie Workman ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Nothing You Do Means Anything](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/michael-workman-nothing-you-do-means-anything).
* Sammy J ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Hero Complex](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/hero-complex).
* Watson ([previously…](/2016/02/27/micf-2016.html#watson)) with [Go To Hell](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/go-to-hell).
* Wil Anderson ([previously…](/2014/03/24/micf-2014-recommendations.html)) with [Critically Wil](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/wil-anderson-critically-wil).

It's worth noting that last year **Laura Davis** and **Wil Anderson** were particularly good, **Daniel Kitson** is regularly superb, and **Zoë Coombs Marr** is bringing back her award-winning show [Trigger Warning](https://www.comedyfestival.com.au/2017/shows/zoe-coombs-marr) (one of my 2016 highlights) for a limited run, for anyone wanting a shorter shortlist.
