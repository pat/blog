Code snippet for application.rb that makes life just a _little_ easier if multiple actions are doing exactly the same thing (both in the controller and the view):

<pre><code>def self.alias_action(existing, aliased)
  define_method(aliased.to_sym) do
    send(existing.to_sym)
    render :action => existing.to_s
  end
end</pre></code>

And then in the appropriate controller (where @edit@ is an existing action, and @show@ needs to be exactly the same):

<pre><code>alias_action :edit, :show</pre></code>

I know this is a specialised use - but perhaps someone else out there is doing something similar.

Hmm, I love where your heart is at. Perhaps

<pre>
def edit; show; end
</pre>

Gets the trick done too :)

Ah, not quite Nic - as the view for the existing action needs to be rendered as well - which is one extra line: @render :action => "show"@ for your example.

But yeah, it's not saving many lines of code, I just find it a little more elegant.
