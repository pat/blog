I wrote "a post last year":http://freelancing-gods.com/posts/micf_2014_recommendations listing excellent comedians to catch at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival - and now I've got friends pestering me for this year's list. Perhaps this will become a regular missive, perhaps not. Either way, here's some tips for this year.

h3. Drop in at Inspire9

As part of that growth, we had clearly outgrown our existing space - a measly 77 square metres - and so plans were hatched for something much larger. Halfway through last year, we moved into our new residence at 41 Stewart St, Richmond (right beside Richmond Station), with 370 square metres to work and play in (and that'll eventually double to 720).

Our office is now a bustling hive of activity - there's usually somewhere between 20 and 30 people in each day at any one point. Many of us have dedicated desks (it is something I happily pay for). That said, not everyone who works from Inspire9 are residents - anyone is welcome to "drop by":http://dropin.inspire9.com.au and use a desk, and it's free.

<p>An unconference for people to share the ideas, stories and skills that they find amazing, which we've been running since 2009 in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. I founded this with two amazing friends: <a href="https://twitter.com/melinachan">Melina Chan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevehopkins">Steve Hopkins</a>, though the teams for each city have all evolved with the input of many fantastic people.</p>

While nothing is as good as being there on the day and partaking in the dialogue, here's what I covered (you'll just have to imagine all the insightful conversation you missed from others who were in the room).
