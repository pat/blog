  <p>I am a software developer and event organiser based in Melbourne, Australia. I work with the team at <a href="http://inspire9dev.com">Inspire9</a> (the web development agency) from within <a href="http://inspire9.com">the coworking space</a> of the same name. I am passionate about the internet, music, politics, comedy, bringing people together, and making a difference. And pancakes.</p>

  <p>When it comes to code, my primary language (since 2007) is Ruby, and my focus has always been on web development. Alongside my work with Inspire9, I run the Heroku add-on <a href="http://info.flying-sphinx.com">Flying Sphinx</a>, and I write plenty of <a href="https://github.com/pat?tab=repositories">open-source code</a>.</p>

  <p>I prefer my politics with a healthy dose of compassion, science, feminism and intelligence, as anyone who has followed me on Twitter for a while will be aware. I try to walk that talk, but there's always room for improvement.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pat">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pat">GitHub</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/freelancing_god">Last.FM</a>.</p>
