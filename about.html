  <p>I am a software developer and event organiser based on Wurundjeri land &mdash; known more commonly as Melbourne, Australia &mdash; and I would like to acknowledge the elders past and present of these traditional custodians of my home.</p>

  <p>I have had the pleasure of working with many amazing teams both here in Melbourne and remotely as a Ruby contractor, and now I am the <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/2016/09/16/co-founding-limbr.html">CTO and cofounder of social impact startup Limbr</a>, which is focused on making mental health care acceptable and accessible. I am passionate about the internet, music, politics, comedy, bringing people together, and making a difference. And <a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/2016/02/09/pancakes-and-gratitude.html">pancakes</a>.</p>

  <p>When it comes to code, my primary language (since 2007) is Ruby, and my focus has always been on web development. I run the Heroku add-on <a href="http://info.flying-sphinx.com">Flying Sphinx</a>, and I write plenty of <a href="https://github.com/pat?tab=repositories">open-source code</a>.</p>

  <p>I prefer my politics with a healthy dose of compassion, science, feminism and intelligence, as anyone who has followed me on Twitter for a while will be aware. I try to walk that talk, but there's always room for improvement.</p>

  <p>You can find me on <a href="https://twitter.com/pat">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://github.com/pat">GitHub</a>, and <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/freelancing_god">Last.FM</a>.</p>
