h2. Getting Started

h3. Requirements

Firstly, you'll want to "install Sphinx":installing_sphinx.html and "Riddle":installing_riddle.html. You can use either Sphinx 0.9.8 or 0.9.9, but don't forget which version you're using. In your Ruby code, you'll need to require the specific version of Riddle.

For example, using 0.9.8:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'riddle'
require 'riddle/0.9.8'
{% endhighlight %}

Or if you're using using 0.9.9:

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'riddle'
require 'riddle/0.9.9'
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Searching

You'll need an active Client instance:

{% highlight ruby %}
client = Riddle::Client.new 'localhost', 9312
{% endhighlight %}

Obviously, change the address and port to suit, if necessary.

Searching is done via the @query@ method:

{% highlight ruby %}
client.query 'search terms', 'index_name', 'comment'
{% endhighlight %}

The index name and comment are optional - the first will default to all indexes (@'*'@), and the second to an empty string.

If you want to use different settings for your search request, you need to set them up before you call the @query@ method. This includes adding filters or setting match modes.

{% highlight ruby %}
client.match_mode = :extended
client.filters << Riddle::Client::Filter.new('attribute', [1, 2])
{% endhighlight %}

h3. Excerpts

Documentation lacking.

h3. Updates

Documentation lacking.

h3. Status

Documentation lacking (although this feature is only for Sphinx 0.9.9, so maybe that's not a problem).

h3. Configuration

Documentation lacking, but Riddle's configuration objects mirror Sphinx's, so it should be pretty easy to figure out.
