<p>An unconference for people to share the ideas, stories and skills that they find amazing, which we've been running since 2009 in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. I founded this with two amazing friends: <a href="https://twitter.com/melinachan">Melina Chan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevehopkins">Steve Hopkins</a>, though the teams for each city have all evolved with the input of many fantastic people.</p>

<p>After twenty events across three cities, Trampoline is now on an indefinite hiatus.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/genlevel">Ben Askins</a> made the first one happen back in 2007, and since then we've had two each year in Australia, plus a growing number in New Zealand, Europe and the USA. I've been part of the organising team for a few, and this event has been a big part of making the Ruby community in Australia extra-special.</p>

<p>These conferences have been happening yearly since 2013. I've worked with amazing teams to help craft the <a href="https://rubyconf.org.au/2015" target="_blank">2015</a> and <a href="https://rubyconf.org.au/2019" target="_blank">2019</a> editions, and have also been lucky enough to speak at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX0e4kf_G7s" target="_blank">2013</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAVtX0yKFSo" target="_blank">2014</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIqcGzQO01k" target="_blank">2017</a> editions.</p>

<p>My first foray into event organising, I led the crew behind the initial Australian Discworld Convention in 2007 - a celebration of the Discworld series of novels by author Terry Pratchett. My involvement has since become rather minimal, but the events are still going strong (and I'm often running games of Werewolf).</p>
