<p>An unconference for people to share the ideas, stories and skills that they find amazing, which we've been running since 2009 in Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide. I founded this with two amazing friends: <a href="https://twitter.com/melinachan">Melina Chan</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stevehopkins">Steve Hopkins</a>, though the teams for each city have all evolved with the input of many fantastic people.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/genlevel">Ben Askins</a> made the first one happen back in 2007, and since then we've had two each year in Australia, plus a growing number in New Zealand, Europe and the USA. I've been part of the organising team for a few, and this event has been a big part of making the Ruby community in Australia extra-special.</p>

<p>The first of these conferences happened in 2013, and I was lucky enough to speak <a href="https://vimeo.com/61172063">that year</a> and <a href="https://vimeo.com/89495400">the following</a>. I then upped the ante and put together an amazing team to run <a href="http://rubyconf.org.au/2015">the 2015 edition</a>.</p>

<p>My first foray into event organising, I led the crew behind the initial Australian Discworld Convention in 2007 - a celebration of the Discworld series of novels by author Terry Pratchett. My involvement has become rather minimal, but it's still going strong (and I'm often running games of Werewolf).</p>
