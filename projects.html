<p>I've written <a href="https://github.com/pat?tab=repositories">many open-source libraries and gems</a>, and have poked around with other projects, but these are perhaps the highlights.</p>

<h3><a href="http://info.flying-sphinx.com">Flying Sphinx</a></h3>

<p>A Heroku add-on for the Sphinx full-text search tool, which I've been running since 2011.</p>

<h3><a href="http://pat.github.io/thinking-sphinx/">Thinking Sphinx</a></h3>

<p>An open-source library for using the Sphinx full-text search tool with Ruby on Rails applications (and ActiveRecord in particular). I began this project in 2007, and it's still under active development.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/pat/sliver">Sliver</a></h3>

<p>An open-source library for building clean, simple and object-oriented Rack APIs with Ruby. I discuss my reasoning about it in <a href="/2015/09/20/rack-apis-with-sliver.html">this blog post</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/pat/combustion">Combustion</a></h3>

<p>An open-source library for testing Ruby on Rails Engines somewhat elegantly. I announced it on my blog <a href="/2011/09/02/combustion-better-rails-engine-testing.html">quite some time ago</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://github.com/pat/gutentag">Gutentag</a></h3>

<p>An open-source library for tagging ActiveRecord objects in Ruby on Rails applications, with a focus on simplicity. <a href="/2013/07/11/gutentag-simple-rails-tagging.html">As I've discussed previously</a>, the code for this project was initially written as an example for a RailsConf workshop on writing gems that I ran in 2013.</p>

<h3><a href="https://drumknottsearch.com">Drumknott</a></h3>

<p>Drumknott provides hosted, embedded search for Jekyll sites - built initially to handle searching on this site, and then turned into a service for others to use as well. I've <a href="/2016/02/15/searching-on-jekyll-sites.html">written about it</a>, and the code behind it is <a href="https://github.com/pat/drumknott-server">open sourced</a>.</p>
